"I was created out of ranker stuff<br />
By Nature, and to the earth by Lust am drawn.<br />
Unto the spirit of evil, not of good,<br />
The earth belongs. What deities send to us<br />
From heaven are only universal goods;<br />
Their light gives gladness, but makes no man rich;<br />
And in their state possession not obtains.<br />
Therefore, the stone of price, all-treasured gold,<br />
Must from the powers of falsehood be enticed,<br />
The evil race that dwells beneath the day.<br />
Not without sacrifice their favor is gained,<br />
And no man liveth who from serving them<br />
Hath extricated undefiled his soul."<br />

<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>


<p>(<i>At rise, is seen the entrance to a tent, out of which
steps an animal-tamer, with long, black curls, dressed
in a white cravat, a vermilion dress-coat, white trowsers
and white top-boots. He carries in his left hand a dog-whip
and in his right a loaded revolver, and enters to the
sound of cymbals and kettle-drums.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent">
Walk in! Walk in to the menagery,<br />
Proud gentlemen and ladies lively and merry!<br />
With avid lust or cold disgust, the very<br />
Beast without Soul bound and made secondary<br />
To human genius, to stay and see!<br />
Walk in, the show'll begin!&mdash;As customary,<br />
One child to each two persons comes in free.</p>

<p class="noindent">
Here battle man and brute in narrow cages<br />
Where one in haught disdain his long whip lashes<br />
And one, with growls as when the thunder rages,<br />
Against the man's throat murderously dashes,&mdash;<br />
Where now the crafty conquers, now the strong,<br />
Now man, now beast, lies cowed the floor along;<br />
The animal rears,&mdash;the human on all fours!<br />
One ice-cold look of dominance&mdash;<br />
The beast submissive bows before that glance,<br />
And the proud heel upon his neck adores.</p>

<p class="noindent">
Bad are the times! Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Who once before my cage in thronging crescents<br />
Crowded, now honor operas, and then<br />
Ibsen, with their so highly valued presence.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a>] </span>My boarders here are so in want of fodder<br />
That they reciprocally devour each other.<br />
How well off at the theater is a player,<br />
Sure of the meat upon his ribs, albeit<br />
His frightful hunger may tear him and he it<br />
And colleagues' inner cupboards be quite bare!&mdash;<br />
Greatness in art we struggle to inherit,<br />
Although the salary never match the merit.</p>

<p class="noindent">
What see you, whether in light or sombre plays?<br />
<em>House-animals</em>, whose morals all must praise,<br />
Who wreak pale spites in vegetarian ways,<br />
And revel in an easy cry or fret,<br />
Just like those others&mdash;down in the parquet.<br />
This hero has a head by one dram swirled;<br />
That is in doubt whether his love be right;<br />
A third you hear despairing of the world,&mdash;<br />
Full five acts long you hear him wail his plight,<br />
And no man ends him with a merciful sleight!<br />
But the <em>real</em> beast, the <em>beautiful</em>, <em>wild</em> beast,<br />
Your eyes on <em>that</em>, <em class="italic">I</em>, ladies, only feast!</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom: 0.25em;">
You see the Tiger, that habitually<br />
Devours whatever falls before his bound;<br />
The Bear, so ravenous originally,<br />
Who at a late night-meal sinks dead to ground;<br />
You see the Monkey, little and amusing,<br />
From sheer ennui his petty powers abusing,&mdash;<br />
He has some talent, of all greatness scant,<br />
So, impudently, coquettes with his own want!<br />
Upon my soul, within my tent's a mammal,<br />
See, right behind the curtain, here,&mdash;a Camel!<br />
And all my creatures fawn about my feet<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a>] </span>When my revolver cracks&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-left: 7em; margin-top: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 0.25em;">(<i>He shoots into the audience.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top: 0.25em;"><span style="margin-left: 13em;">Behold!</span><br />
Brutes tremble all around me. I am cold:<br />
The <em>man</em> stays cold,&mdash;you, with respect, to greet.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom: 0.25em;">
Walk in!&mdash;You hardly trust yourselves in here?&mdash;<br />
Then very well, judge for yourselves! Each sphere<br />
Has sent its crawling creatures to your telling:<br />
Chameleons and serpents, crocodiles,<br />
Dragons, and salamanders chasm-dwelling,&mdash;<br />
I know, of course, you're full of quiet smiles<br />
And don't believe a syllable I say.&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent center" style="margin-top: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 0.25em;">(<i>He lifts the entrance-flap and calls into the tent.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 0.25em;">Hi, Charlie!&mdash;bring our <em>Serpent</em> just this way!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 0.25em;">(<i>A stage-hand with a big paunch carries out the actress
of <em>Lulu</em> in her Pierrot costume, and sets her down before
the animal-tamer.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 0.25em;">
She was created to incite to sin,<br />
To lure, seduce, poison&mdash;yea, murder, in<br />
A manner no man knows.&mdash;My pretty beast,</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-left: 9em; margin-top: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 0.25em;">(<i>Tickling Lulu's chin.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Only be <em>unaffected</em>, and not pieced<br />
Out with distorted, artificial folly,<br />
Even if the critics praise thee for 't less wholly.<br />
Thou hast no right to spoil the shape most fitting,<br />
Most <em>true</em>, of <em>woman</em>, with meows and spitting!<br />
And mind, all foolery and making faces<br />
The <em>childish simpleness</em> of <em>Vice</em> disgraces.<br />
Thou shouldst&mdash;to-day I speak emphatically&mdash;<br />
Speak <em>naturally</em> and not unnaturally,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a>] </span>For the first principle in every art,<br />
Since earliest times, was <em>True</em> and <em>Plain</em>, not <em>Smart</em>!<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent center" style="margin-bottom: 0.25em; margin-top: 1em;">(<i>To the public.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 0.25em;">
There's nothing special now to see in her,<br />
But wait and watch what later will occur!<br />
Her strength about the Tiger she coils stricter:<br />
He roars and groans!&mdash;Who'll be the final victor?&mdash;<br />
Hop, Charlie, march! Carry her to her place,</p>

<p class="noindent center" style="margin-top: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 0.25em;">(<i>The stage-hand carries Lulu in his arms; the animal-tamer

</p>

<p class="noindent center" style="margin-top: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 1em;">(<i>The stage-hand carries Lulu back into the tent.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.25em;">
And now I'll tell the best thing in the day:<br />
My poll between the teeth of a beast of prey!<br />
Walk in! Tho to be sure the show's not new,<br />
Yet everyone takes pleasure in its view!<br />
Wrench open this wild animal's jaws I dare,<br />
And he to bite dares not! My pate's so <em>fair</em>,<br />
So <em>wild</em>, so <em>gaily decked</em>, it wins respect!<br />
I offer it him with confidence unchecked.<br />
One <em>joke</em>, and my two temples crack!&mdash;but, lo,<br />
The lightning of my eyes I will forego,<br />
Staking my <em>life</em> against a <em>joke</em>! and throw<br />
My whip, my weapons, down. I am in my skin!<br />
I yield me to this beast!&mdash;His name do ye know?<br />
&mdash;The honored public! that has just walked in!<br />

<h2>ACT I</h2>


<p><i>A roomy studio. Entrance door at the rear, left.
Another door at lower left to the bed-room. At centre,
a platform for the model, with a Spanish screen behind
it and a Smyrna rug in front. Two easels at lower
right. On the upper one is the picture of a young girl's
head and shoulders. Against the other leans a reversed
canvas. Below these, toward centre, an ottoman, with a
tiger-skin on it. Two chairs along the left wall. In the
back-ground, right, a step-ladder.</i></p>

<p><i>Schön sits on the foot of the ottoman, inspecting critically
the picture on the further easel. Schwarz stands
behind the ottoman, his palette and brushes in his hands.</i></p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Do you know, I'm getting acquainted with a
brand new side of the lady.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I have never painted anyone whose expression
changed so continuously. I could hardly keep a
single feature the same two days running.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Pointing to the picture and observing him.</i>)
Do you find that in it?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I have done everything imaginable to call
forth some sort of quiet in her mood by my conversation
during the sittings.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Then I understand the difference. (<i>Schwarz
dips his brush in the oil and draws it over the features
of the face.</i>) Do you think that makes it look more like
her?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> We can only work with art as scientifically
as possible.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Tell me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Stepping back.</i>) The color had sunk in
pretty well, too.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Looking at him.</i>) Have you ever loved a
woman in your life?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Goes to the easel, puts a color on it, and
steps back on the other side.</i>) The dress isn't made to
stand out enough yet. We don't see the living body under
it.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I make no doubt that the workmanship is
good.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> If you'll step this way....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Rising.</i>) You must have told her regular
ghost-stories.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> As far back as you can.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Stepping back, knocks down the canvas that
was leaning against the lower easel.</i>) Excuse me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Picking it up.</i>) That's all right.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) What is that?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Do you know her?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> No. (<i>Schwarz sets the picture on the easel.
It is of a lady dressed as Pierrot with a long shepherd's
crook in her hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> A costume-picture.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> But, really, you've succeeded with <em>her</em>.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> You know her?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> No. And in that costume&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> It isn't nearly finished yet. (<i>Schön nods.</i>)
What would you have? While she is posing for me I
have the pleasure of entertaining her husband.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> We talk about art, of course,&mdash;to complete
my good fortune!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> But how did you make such a charming acquaintance?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> As they're generally made. An ancient,
tottering little man drops in on me here to know if I
can paint his wife. Why, of course, were she as wrinkled
as Mother Earth! Next day at ten prompt the doors fly
open, and the fat-belly drives this little beauty in before
him. I can feel even now how my knees shook. Then
comes a sap-green lackey, stiff as a ramrod, with a package
under his arm. Where is the dressing-room? Imagine
my plight. I open the door there (<i>pointing left</i>).
Just luck that everything was in order. The sweet thing
vanishes into it, and the old fellow posts himself outside
as a bastion. Two minutes later out she steps in this
Pierrot. (<i>Shaking his head.</i>) I never saw anything like
it. (<i>He goes left and stares in at the bedroom.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Who has followed him with his eyes.</i>)
And the fat-belly stands guard?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Turning round.</i>) The whole body in
harmony with that impossible costume as if it had come
into the world in it! Her way of burying her elbows
in her pockets, of lifting her little feet from the rug,&mdash;the
blood often shoots to my head....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> One can see that in the picture.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Shaking his head.</i>) People like us, you
know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Here the model is mistress of the conversation.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> She has never yet opened her mouth.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Is it possible?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Allow me to show the costume to you.
(<i>Goes out left.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Before the Pierrot.</i>) A devilish beauty.
(<i>Before the other picture.</i>) There's more depth here.
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a>] </span>(<i>Coming down stage.</i>) He is still rather young for his
age. (<i>Schwarz comes back with a white satin costume.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> What sort of material is that?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Feeling it.</i>) Satin.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> And all in one piece.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> How does one get into it then?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> That I can't tell you.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Taking the costume by the legs.</i>) What
enormous trowser-legs!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> The left one she pulls up.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Looking at the picture.</i>) Above the knee!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> She does that entrancingly!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> And transparent stockings?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Those have got to be painted, specially.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Oh, you can do that.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> And with it all a coquetry!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> What brought you to that horrible suspicion?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> There are things that our school-philosophy
lets itself never dream of. (<i>He takes the costume
back into his bedroom.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Alone.</i>) When we sleep....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Comes back; looks at his watch.</i>) If
you wish to make her acquaintance too&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> They must be here in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> How much longer will the lady have to sit?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I shall probably have to bear the pains of
Tantalus three months longer.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I mean the other one.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I beg your pardon. Three times more at
most. (<i>Going to the door with him.</i>) If the lady will
just leave me the upper part of the dress then....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> With pleasure. Let us see you at my house
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a>] </span>again soon. For Heaven's sake! (<i>As he collides in the
door-way with Dr.&nbsp;Goll and Lulu.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> May I introduce&nbsp;...</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>To Schön.</i>) What are you doing here?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>As Schön kisses her hand in greeting.</i>)
You're not going already?</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> But what wind blows you here?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I've been looking at the picture of my bride.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Coming forward.</i>) Your bride is here?</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> So you're having work done here, too?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Before the upper picture.</i>) Look at it! Enchanting!
Entrancing!</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>Looking round him.</i>) Have you got
her hidden somewhere round here?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> So that is the sweet young prodigy who's made
a new person out of you....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> She sits in the afternoon mostly.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> And you don't tell anyone about it?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Turning round.</i>) Is she really so solemn?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Probably the after-effects of the seminary still,
dear lady.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>Before the picture.</i>) One can see that you
have been transformed profoundly.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> But now you mustn't let her wait any longer.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> In a fortnight I think the engagement will
come out.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) Let's lose no time. Hop!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>To Schön.</i>) Just think, we came at a trot
over the new bridge. I was driving, myself.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>As Schön prepares to leave.</i>) No, no.
We two will talk some more later. Get along, Nellie.
Hop!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Now you're going to talk about me!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a>] </span><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Our Apelles is already wiping his brushes.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I had imagined it would be much more amusing.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> But you have always the satisfaction of preparing
for us the greatest and rarest pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Going left.</i>) Oh, just wait!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Before the bedroom door.</i>) If madame
will be so kind.... (<i>Shuts the door after her and
stands in front of it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> I christened her Nellie, you know, in our
marriage-contract.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Did you?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> What do you think of it?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Why not call her rather Mignon?</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> That would have been good, too. I didn't
think of that.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Do you consider the name so important?</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Hm.... You know, I have no children.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> But you've only been married a couple of
months.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Thanks, I don't want any.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Having taken out his cigarette-case.</i>) Have
a cigarette?</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>Helps himself.</i>) I've plenty to do with
this one. (<i>To Schwarz.</i>) Say, what's your little danseuse
doing now?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Turning round on Schwarz.</i>) You and a
danseuse?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> The lady was sitting for me at that time
only as a favor. I made her acquaintance on a flying
trip of the Cecilia Society.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>To Schön.</i>) Hm.... I think we're
getting a change of weather.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> The toilet isn't going so quickly, is it?</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> It's going like lightning! Woman has got
to be a virtuoso in her job. So must we all, each in
his job, if life isn't to turn to beggary. (<i>Calls.</i>) Hop,
Nellie!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Inside.</i>) Just a second!</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>To Schön.</i>) I can't get onto these blockheads.
(<i>Referring to Schwarz.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I can't help envying them. These blockheads
know nothing holier than an altar-cloth, and feel
richer than you and me with 30,000-mark incomes. Besides,
you can't be judge of a man who from childhood
has lived from palette to mouth. Try to get at his
finances: it's an arithmetic example! I haven't the moral
courage, and one can easily burn one's fingers at it, too.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>As Pierrot, steps out of the bed-room.</i>)
Here I am!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Turns; after a pause.</i>) Superb!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Nearer.</i>) Well?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You put shame on the boldest fancy.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> How do you like me?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> A picture before which art must despair.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Don't you think so, too?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) Have you any notion what you
do?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I'm perfectly possessed of myself!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Then you might be a little more discreet.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> But I'm only doing what's my duty.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You are powdered?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> What do you take me for!</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> I've never seen such a white skin as she's
got. I've told our Raphael here, too, to do just as little
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a>] </span>with the flesh tints as possible. For once, I can't get
enthusiastic about the modern art-nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>By the easels, preparing his paints.</i>) At
any rate, it's thanks to impressionism that present-day art
can stand up beside the old masters without blushing.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Oh, it can do quite well for a bit of butcher's
work.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> For Heaven's sake don't get excited! (<i>Lulu
falls on Goll's neck and kisses him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> They can see your undershirt. You must
pull it lower.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I would soonest have left it off. It only bothers
me.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> He should be able to paint it out.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Taking the shepherd's crook that leans
against the Spanish screen, and mounting the platform,
to Schön.</i>) What would you say now, if you had to
stand at attention for two hours?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I'd sell my soul to the devil for the chance
to exchange with you.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>Sitting, left.</i>) Come over here. Here is
my post of observation.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Plucking her left trowser-leg up to the knee,
to Schwarz.</i>) So?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Yes....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Plucking it a thought higher.</i>) So?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Yes, yes....</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>To Schön who has seated himself on the
chair next him, with a gesture.</i>) From this place I find
her still more attractive.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Without stirring.</i>) I beg pardon! I am
equally attractive on all sides.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) The right knee further forward,
please.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>With a gesture.</i>) The body does show finer
lines perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> The light to-day can be borne at least half
way.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Oh, you must throw on lots of it! Hold
your brush a bit longer.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Certainly, Dr.&nbsp;Goll.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Treat her as a piece of still-life.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Certainly, Doctor. (<i>To Lulu.</i>) You
used to hold your head a wee mite higher, Mrs. Goll.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Raising her head.</i>) Paint my lips a little
open.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Paint snow on ice. If you get warm doing
that, then instantly your art gets inartistic!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Certainly, Doctor.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Art, you know, must so reproduce nature
that one can find at least some <em>spiritual</em> enjoyment
in it!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Opening her mouth a little, to Schwarz.</i>)
So&mdash;look. I'll hold it half opened, so.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> As soon as the sun comes, the wall opposite
throws warm reflections in here.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) You must keep your position
just as if our Velasquez here didn't exist at all.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Well, a painter <em>isn't</em> a man at all, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I don't think you ought to judge the whole
profession by just one famous exception.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Stepping back from the easel.</i>) I should
have liked to have had to hire a different studio last
fall.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>To Goll.</i>) What I wanted to ask you&mdash;have
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a>] </span>you seen the little Murphy girl yet as a Peruvian
pearl-fisher?</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> I see her to-morrow for the fourth time.
Prince Polossov took me. His hair has already got dark
yellow again with delight.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> So you find her quite fabulous too.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Who ever wants to judge of that beforehand?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I think someone knocked.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Pardon me a moment. (<i>Goes and opens
the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) You can safely smile at him
with less bashfulness!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> He makes nothing of it.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> And if he did!&mdash;What are we two sitting
here for?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Entering, still behind the Spanish
screen.</i>) May one come in?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> My son!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Oh! It's Mr.&nbsp;Alva!</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Don't mind. Just come along in.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Stepping forward, shakes hands with Schön
and Goll.</i>) Glad to see you. (<i>Turning toward Lulu.</i>)
Do I see a-right? Oh, if only I could engage you for
my title part!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I don't think I could dance nearly well enough
for your show!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> But you do have a dancing-master such as cannot
be found on any stage in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> But what brings you here?</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Maybe you're having somebody or other
painted here, too, in secret!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a>] </span><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>To Schön.</i>) I wanted to take you to the
dress rehearsal.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>As Schön rises.</i>) Do you have 'em dance
to-day in full costume?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Of course. Come along, too. In five minutes
I must be on the stage. (<i>To Lulu.</i>) Unhappy!</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> I've forgotten&mdash;what's the name of your
ballet?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Dalailama.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> I thought <em>he</em> was in a madhouse.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You're thinking of Nietzsche, Doctor.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> You're right; I got 'em mixed up.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I have helped Buddhism to its legs.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> By his legs is the stage-poet known.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Corticelli dances the youthful Buddha as tho
she had seen the light of the world by the Ganges.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> So long as her mother lived, she danced with
her legs.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Then when she got free she danced with her
intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Now she dances with her heart.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> If you'd like to see her&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Come along with us!</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Impossible.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Anyway, we have no time to lose.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Come with us, doctor. In the third act you
see Dalailama in his cloister, with his monks&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> The only thing I care about is the young
Buddha.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Well, what's hindering you?</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> I can't. I can't do it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a>] </span><span class="small">ALVA.</span> We're going to Peter's, after it. There you
can express your admiration.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Don't press it on me, please.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You'll see the tame monkey, the two Brahmans,
the little girls....</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> For heaven's sake, just keep away from
me with your little girls!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Reserve one of the proscenium boxes for us
on Monday, Mr.&nbsp;Alva.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> How could you doubt that I would, dear lady!</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> When I come back the whole picture will
be spoilt on me.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Well, it could be painted over.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> If I don't explain to this Caravacci every
stroke of his brush&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Your fears are unfounded, I think....</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Next time, gentlemen!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> The Brahmans are getting impatient. The
daughters of Nirvana are shivering in their tights.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Damned enchantment!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> They'll quarrel with us, if we don't bring
you with us.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> In five minutes I'll be back. (<i>Stands down
right, behind Schwarz and compares the picture with
Lulu.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) Duty calls me, gracious lady!</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>To Schwarz.</i>) You must model it a bit
more here. The hair is bad. You aren't paying enough
attention to your business!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Come on.</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> Now, just hop it! Ten horses will not
drag me to Peter's.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Following Alva and Goll.</i>) We'll take my
carriage. It's waiting downstairs. (<i>Exeunt.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Leans over to the right, and spits.</i>)
Pack! If only that were life's end! The bread-basket!&mdash;paunch
and mug! Now rears my artist's pride. (<i>After
a look at Lulu.</i>) This company!&mdash; (<i>Gets up, goes up
left, observes Lulu from all sides, and sits again at his
easel.</i>) The choice would be a hard one to make. If I
may request Mrs. Goll to raise the right hand a little
higher.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Grasps the crook as high as she can reach;
to herself.</i>) Who would have thought that was possible!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I am quite ridiculous, you think?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He's coming right back.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I can do nothing but paint.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> There he is!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Rising.</i>) Well?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Don't you hear?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Someone is coming....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I knew it.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> It's the janitor. He's sweeping the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Thank heaven!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Do you perhaps accompany the doctor to
his patients?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Everything <em>but</em> that.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Because, you are not accustomed to being
alone.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> We have a housekeeper at home.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> She keeps you company?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> She has a lot of taste.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> She dresses me.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Do you go much to balls?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> Never.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Then what do you need the dresses for?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> For dancing.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> You really dance?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Czardas ... Samaqueca ... Skirt-dance.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Doesn't&mdash;that&mdash;disgust you, then?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You find me ugly?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> You don't understand me. But who gives
you lessons then?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Him.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Who?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Him.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> He?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He plays the violin&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Every day one learns something new of
the world!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I learned in Paris. I took lessons from Eugenie
Fougère. She let me copy her costumes, too.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> What are <em>they</em> like?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> A little green lace skirt to the knee, all in
ruffles, low-necked, of course, very low-necked and awfully
tight-laced. Bright green petticoat, then brighter and
brighter. Snow-white underclothes with a hand's-breadth
of lace....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I can no longer&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Then paint!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Scraping the canvas.</i>) Aren't you cold
at all?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> God forbid! No. What made you ask? Are
you so cold?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Not to-day. No.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Praise God, one can breathe!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> How so?... (<i>Lulu takes a deep breath.</i>)
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a>] </span>Don't do that, please! (<i>Springs up, throws away his
palette and brushes, walks up and down.</i>) The boot-black

his money, either. If I go without supper to-morrow, no
little society lady will ask me if I know anything about
oyster-patties!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Is he going out of his head?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Takes up his work again.</i>) What ever
drove the fellow to this test!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I'd like it better, too, if he had stayed here.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> We are truly the martyrs of our calling!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I didn't wish to cause you pain.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Hesitating, to Lulu.</i>) If you&mdash;the left
trowser-leg&mdash;a little higher&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Here?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Steps to the platform.</i>) Permit me....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I'll show you.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You mustn't.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> You are nervous&nbsp;... (<i>Tries to seize her
hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Throws the crook in his face.</i>) Let me alone!
(<i>Hurries to the entrance door.</i>) You don't get me for
a long time yet.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> You can't understand a joke.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Oh, yes I can. I understand everything. Just
you leave me be. You'll get nothing at all from me by
force. Go to your work. You have no right to molest
me. (<i>Flees behind the ottoman.</i>) Sit down behind your
easel!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Trying to get around the ottoman.</i>) As
soon as I've punished you&mdash;you wayward, capricious&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> But you must have me, first! Go away. You
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a>] </span>can't catch me. In long clothes I'd have fallen into your
clutches long ago&mdash;but in the Pierrot!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Throwing himself across the ottoman.</i>)
I've got you!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Hurls the tiger-skin over his head.</i>) Good-night!
(<i>Jumps over the platform and climbs up the step-ladder.</i>)
I can see away over all the cities of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Unrolling himself from the rug.</i>) This
old skin!!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I reach up into heaven, and stick the stars in
my hair.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Clambering after her.</i>) I'll shake it till
you fall off!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> If you don't stop, I'll throw the ladder down.
(<i>Climbing higher.</i>) Will you let go of my legs? God
save the Poles! (<i>Makes the ladder fall over, jumps onto
the platform, and as Schwarz picks himself up from the
floor, throws the Spanish screen down on his head. Hastening
down-stage, by the easels.</i>) I told you that you
weren't going to get me.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Coming forward.</i>) Let us make peace.
(<i>Tries to embrace her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Keep away from me, or&mdash; (<i>She throws the
easel with the finished picture at him, so that both fall
crashing to the floor.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Screams.</i>) Merciful Heaven!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Upstage, right.</i>) You knocked the hole in
it yourself!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I am ruined! Ten weeks' work, my journey,
my exhibition! Now there is nothing more to lose!
(<i>Plunges after her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Springs over the ottoman, over the fallen step-ladder,
and over the platform, down-stage.</i>) A grave!
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a>] </span>Don't fall into it! (<i>She stamps thru the picture on the
floor.</i>) She made a new man out of him! (<i>Falls
forward.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Stumbling over the Spanish screen.</i>) I
am merciless now!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Up-stage.</i>) Leave me in peace now. I'm
getting dizzy. O Gott! O Gott!... (<i>Comes forward
and sinks down on the ottoman. Schwarz locks
the door; then seats himself next her, grasps her hand,
and covers it with kisses&mdash;then pauses, struggling with
himself. Lulu opens her eyes wide.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He may come back.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> How d'&nbsp;you feel?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> As if I had fallen into the water....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I love you.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> One time, I loved a student.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Nellie&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> With four-and-twenty scars&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I love you, Nellie.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> My name isn't Nellie. (<i>Schwarz kisses her.</i>)
It's Lulu.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I would call you Eve.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Do you know what time it is?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Looking at his watch.</i>) Half past ten.
(<i>Lulu takes the watch and opens the case.</i>) You don't
love me.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Yes I do.... It's five minutes after half past
ten.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Give me a kiss, Eve!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Takes him by the chin and kisses him.
Throws the watch in the air and catches it.</i>) You smell
of tobacco.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Why so distant?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> It would be uncomfortable to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> You're just making believe!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You're making believe yourself, it seems to
me. <em class="italic">I</em> make believe? What makes you think that? <em>I
never needed to do that.</em></p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Rises, disconcerted, passing his hand over
his <a name="forehead" id="forehead"></a><ins class='correction' title='forhead'>forehead</ins>.</i>) God in Heaven! The world is strange
to me&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Instantly whirling round.</i>) <em>Thou

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Half raising herself.</i>) <em>You have never

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>Outside.</i>) Open the door!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Already sprung to her feet.</i>) Hide me! O
God, hide me!</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>Pounding on the door.</i>) Open the door!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Holding back Schwarz as he goes toward
the door.</i>) He will strike me dead!</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> (<i>Hammering.</i>) Open the door!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Sunk down before Schwarz, gripping his
knees.</i>) He'll beat me to death! He'll beat me to death!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Stand up.... (<i>The door falls crashing
into the studio. Dr.&nbsp;Goll with blood-shot eyes rushes upon
Schwarz and Lulu, brandishing his stick.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">DR. GOLL.</span> You dogs! You&nbsp;...! (<i>Pants, struggles
for breath a few seconds, and falls headlong to the
ground. Schwarz's knees tremble. Lulu has fled to the
door. Pause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Mister&mdash;Doctor&mdash;Doc&mdash;Doctor Goll&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>In the door.</i>) Please, though, first put the
studio in order.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Dr.&nbsp;Goll! (<i>Leans over.</i>) Doc&mdash; (<i>Steps

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Trying to turn him over.</i>) Dr.&nbsp;Goll.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He doesn't hear.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> But you, help me, please.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> The two of us together couldn't lift him.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Straightening up.</i>) We must send for a
doctor.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He is fearfully heavy.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Getting his hat.</i>) Please, though, be so
good as to put the place a little to rights while I'm away.
(<i>He goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He'll spring up all at once. (<i>Intensely.</i>)
Bussi! He just won't notice anything. (<i>Comes down-stage
in a wide circle.</i>) He sees my feet, and watches
every step I take. He has his eye on me everywhere.
(<i>Touches him with her toe.</i>) Bussi! (<i>Flinching, backward.</i>)
It's serious with him. The dance is over. He'll
send me to prison. What shall I do? (<i>Leans over, to
the floor.</i>) A strange, wild face! (<i>Getting up.</i>) And
no one to do him the last services&mdash;isn't that sad!
(<i>Schwarz returns.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Still not come to himself?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Down right.</i>) What shall I do?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Bending over Goll.</i>) Doctor Goll.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I almost think it's serious.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Talk decently!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> <em>He</em> wouldn't say that to me. He makes me
dance for him when he doesn't feel well.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> The doctor will be here in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Doctoring won't help <em>him</em>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> But people do what they can, in such
cases!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> <em>He</em> doesn't think so.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Then won't you at least&mdash;get dressed?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Yes,&mdash;right off.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> What are you waiting for?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Please&nbsp;...</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Shut <em>his</em> eyes.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> You make me shiver.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Not nearly so much as you make <em>me</em>!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You're a born criminal.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Doesn't this moment touch you at all,
then?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> It hits me, too, some.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Please, just you keep still now!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> It hits you some, too.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> You really didn't need to say that to a
man, in such a moment.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> <em>Please&nbsp;...!</em></p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Do what you think necessary. I don't
know how.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Left of Goll.</i>) He's looking at me.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Right of Goll.</i>) And at me, too.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You're a coward!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Shuts Goll's eyes with his handkerchief.</i>)
It's the first time in my life that anyone has called me
that.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Didn't you do it to your mother?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Nervously.</i>) No.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You were away, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> Or else you were afraid?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Violently.</i>) No!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Shivering, backward.</i>) I didn't mean to insult you.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> She's still alive.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Then you still have somebody.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> She's as poor as a beggar.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I know what that is.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Don't laugh at me!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Now I am rich&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> It gives me cold shudders&mdash; (<i>Goes right.</i>)
She can't help it!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>To herself.</i>) What'll I do?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>To himself.</i>) Absolutely depraved!
(<i>They look at each other mistrustfully. Schwarz goes
over to her and grips her hand.</i>) Look me in the eyes!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Apprehensively.</i>) What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Takes her to the ottoman and makes her
sit next to him.</i>) Look me in the eyes.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I see myself in them as Pierrot.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Shoves her from him.</i>) Confounded
dancer-ing!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I must change my clothes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Holds her back.</i>) One question&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I can't answer it.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Can you speak the truth?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Do you believe in a Creator?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Can you swear on anything?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I don't know. Leave me alone. You're mad.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> What do you believe in, then?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Have you no soul, then?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Have you ever once loved&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Gets up, goes right, to himself.</i>) She
doesn't know!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Without moving.</i>) I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Glancing at Goll.</i>) He knows.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Nearer him.</i>) What do you want to know?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Angrily.</i>) Go, get dressed! (<i>Lulu
goes into the bed-room. To Goll.</i>) Would I could
change with you, you dead man! I give her back to you.
I give my youth to you, too. I lack the courage and the
faith. I've had to wait patiently too long. It's too late
for me. I haven't grown up big enough for happiness.
I have a hellish fear of it. Wake up! I didn't touch
her. He opens his mouth. Mouth open and eyes shut,
like the children. With me it's the other way round.
Wake up, wake up! (<i>Kneels down and binds his handkerchief
round the dead man's head.</i>) Here I beseech
Heaven to make me <em>able</em> to be happy&mdash;to give me the
strength and the freedom of soul to be just a weeny mite
happy! For <em>her sake, only for her sake</em>.
(<i>Lulu comes out of the bed-room, completely dressed, her
hat on, and her right hand under her left arm.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Raising her left arm, to Schwarz.</i>) Would
you hook me up here? My hand trembles.</p>

<h2>ACT II</h2>


<p><i>A very ornamental parlor. Entrance-door rear, left.
Curtained entrances right and left, steps leading up to the
right one. On the back wall over the fire-place, Lulu's
picture as Pierrot in a magnificent frame. Right, a tall
mirror; a couch in front of it. Left, an ebony writing-table.
Centre, a few chairs around a little Chinese table.</i></p>

<p><i>Lulu stands motionless before the mirror, in a green
silk morning-dress. She frowns, passes a hand over her
forehead, feels her cheeks, and draws back from the mirror
with a discouraged, almost angry, look. Frequently turning
round, she goes left, opens a casket on the writing-table,
lights herself a cigarette, looks for a book among
those that are lying on the table, takes one, and lies down
on the couch opposite the mirror. After reading a moment,
she lets the book sink, and nods seriously to herself
in the glass; then resumes reading. Schwarz enters, left,
palette and brushes in hand, and bends over Lulu, kisses
her on the forehead, and goes up the steps, right.</i></p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Turning in the door-way.</i>) Eve!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Smiling.</i>) At your orders?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Seems to me you look extra charming to-day.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>With a glance at the mirror.</i>) Depends on
what you expect.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Your hair breathes out a morning freshness....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I've just come out of the water.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Approaching her.</i>) I've an awful lot to
do to-day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> That's what you say to yourself.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Lays his palette and brushes down on the
carpet, and sits on the edge of the couch.</i>) What are
you reading?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Reads.</i>) "Suddenly she heard an anchor of
refuge come nodding up the stairs."</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Who under the sun writes so absorbingly?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Reading.</i>) "It was the postman with a
money-order." (<i>Henriette, the servant, comes in, upper
left, with a hat-box on her arm and a little tray of letters
which she puts on the table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">HENRIETTE.</span> The mail. I'm going to take your hat
to the milliner, madam. Anything else?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> No. (<i>Schwarz signs to her to go out, which
she does, slyly smiling.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> What was it you dreamt all last night?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You've asked me that twice already, to-day.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Rises, takes up the letters.</i>) I tremble
for news. Every day I fear the world may go to pieces.
(<i>Giving Lulu a letter.</i>) For you.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Sniffs at the paper.</i>) Madame Corticelli.
(<i>Hides it in her bosom.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Skimming a letter.</i>) My Samaqueca-dancer
sold&mdash;for fifty thousand marks!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Who says that?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Sedelmeier in Paris. That's the third
picture since our marriage. I hardly know how to save
myself from my luck!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Pointing to the letters.</i>) There are more
there.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Opening an engagement announcement.</i>)
See. (<i>Gives it to Lulu.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Reads.</i>) Sir Henry von Zarnikow has the
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a>] </span>honor to announce the engagement of his daughter, Charlotte
Marie Adelaide, to Doctor Ludwig Schön.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>As he opens another letter.</i>) At last!
He's been an eternal while evading a public engagement.
I can't understand it&mdash;a man of his standing and influence.
What can be in the way of his marriage?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> What is that that you're reading?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> An invitation to take part in the international
exhibition at St.&nbsp;Petersburg. I have no idea
what to paint for it.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Some entrancing girl or other, of course.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Will you be willing to pose for it?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> God knows there are other pretty girls enough
in existence!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> But with any other model&mdash;tho she be
as racy as hell&mdash;I can't get such a full display of my powers.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Then I must, I suppose. Wouldn't it go as
well lying down?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Really, I'd liefest have your taste arrange
it for me. (<i>Folding up the letters.</i>) Don't let's forget
to congratulate Schön to-day, anyway. (<i>Goes left and
shuts the letters in the writing-table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> But we did that a long time ago.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> For his bride's sake.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You can write to him again if you want.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> And now to work! (<i>Takes up his brushes
and palette, kisses Lulu, goes up the steps, right, and turns
around in the door-way.</i>) Eve!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Lets her book sink, smiling.</i>) Your pleasure?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Approaching her.</i>) I feel every day as
if I were seeing you for the very first time.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You're a terror.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> The fault is yours. (<i>He sinks on his
knees by the couch and caresses her hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Stroking his hair.</i>) You're <em>wasting</em> me.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> You <em>are mine</em>. But you are never
more ensnaring than when you ought for God's sake to be,
just once, real ugly for a couple of hours! Since I've
had you, I have had nothing more. I'm entirely lost to
myself.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Not so excited! (<i>Bell rings in the corridor.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Pulling himself together.</i>) Confound it!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> No one at home!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Perhaps it's the art-dealer&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> And if it's the Chinese Emperor!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> One moment. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Visionary.</i>) Thou? Thou? (<i>Closes her
eyes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Coming back.</i>) A beggar, who says he
was in the war. I have no small change on me. (<i>Taking
up his palette and brushes.</i>) It's high time, too, that I

touches herself up before the glass, strokes back her hair,
and goes out, returning leading in Schigolch.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I'd thought he was more of a swell&mdash;a
little more glory to him. He's sort of embarrassed. He
quaked a little in the knees when he saw <em>me</em> in front
of him.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Shoving a chair round for him.</i>) How can
you beg from him, too?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> That's why I've dragged my seventy-seven
summers just here. You told me he kept at his
painting in the mornings.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He hadn't got quite awake yet. How much
do you need?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Two hundred, if you have that much
handy. Personally, I'd like three hundred. Some of my
clients have evaporated.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Goes to the writing-table and rummages in
the drawer.</i>) Whew, I'm tired!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Looking round him.</i>) That's just what
brought me, too. I've been wanting a long time to see
how things were looking now with you.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> It just sweeps over you. (<i>Looking up.</i>)
Like with me fifty years ago. Instead of the loafing chairs
we still had rusty old sabres then. Devil, but you've
brought it pretty far! (<i>Scuffing.</i>) Carpets....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Giving him two bills.</i>) I like best to walk
on them bare-footed.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Scanning Lulu's portrait.</i>) Is that you?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Winking.</i>) Pretty fine?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> If all that's genuine.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Have something sweet?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Getting up.</i>) Elixir de Spaa.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> That doesn't help <a name="me" id="me"></a><ins class='correction' title='me&mdash; Does'>me&mdash;Does</ins> he drink?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Taking a decanter and glasses from a cupboard
near the fireplace.</i>) Not yet. (<i>Coming down
stage.</i>) The cordial has such various effects!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> He comes to blows?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He goes to sleep. (<i>She fills the two glasses.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> When he's drunk, you can see right into
his insides.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I'd rather <em>not</em>. (<i>Sits opposite Schigolch.</i>)
Tell me about it.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> The streets keep on getting longer, and
my legs shorter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> And your harmonica?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Has bad air, like me with my asthma. I
just keep a-thinking it isn't worth the trouble to make it
better. (<i>They clink glasses.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Emptying her glass.</i>) I thought you'd come
to an end a long time ago&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> To an end&mdash;already up and away? I
thought so, too. But no matter how early the sun goes
down, still we aren't let lie quiet. I'm hoping for winter.
Perhaps then my <a name="my" id="my"></a>(<i>coughing</i><ins class='correction' title=')&mdash;'>) &mdash;</ins>my&mdash;my asthma will invent
some opportunity to carry me off.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Filling the glasses.</i>) Do you think they could
have forgotten you on the other side?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Would be possible, for it certainly isn't
going like it usually does. (<i>Stroking her knee.</i>) Now
you tell&mdash;not seen you a long time&mdash;my little Lulu.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Jerking back, smiling.</i>) Life is beyond me!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> What do you know about it? You're
still so young!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> That you call me Lulu.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Lulu, isn't it? Have I ever called you
anything else?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> In the memory of man my name has no longer
been Lulu.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Another way of naming?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Lulu sounds to me quite ante-diluvian.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Children! Children!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> My name now is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> As if the principle wasn't always the
same!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You mean&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> What is it now?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> <em>Eve.</em></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Lept, hopped, skipped, jumped....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I'm listening.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Gazing round.</i>) This is the way I
dreamt of it for you. You've aimed straight for it.
(<i>Seeing Lulu sprinkling herself with perfume.</i>) What's
that?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Heliotrope.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Does that smell better than you?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Sprinkling him.</i>) That needn't bother you
any more.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Who would have dreamt of this royal
luxury before!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> When I think back&mdash;Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Stroking her knee.</i>) How's it going
with you, then? You still keep at the French?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I lie and sleep.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> That's genteel. That always looks like
something. And afterwards?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I stretch&mdash;till it cracks.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> And when it has cracked?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> What do you mind about that?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> What do I mind about that? What do
I mind? I'd rather live till the last trump and renounce
all heavenly joys than leave my Lulu deprived of anything
down here behind me. What do I mind about that?
It's my sympathy. To be sure, my better self <em>is</em> already
transfigured&mdash;but I still have some sense for this world.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I haven't.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> You're too well off.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Shuddering.</i>) Idiot....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Better than with the old dancing-bear?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Sadly.</i>) I don't dance any more.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> For him it was time, too.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> Now I am&mdash; (<i>Stops.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Speak how it is with you, child! I believed
in you when there was no more to be seen in you
than your two big eyes. What are you now?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> A beast....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> That you&mdash;! And what kind of a
beast? A fine beast! An elegant beast! A glorified
beast! Then I'll let them bury me. We're through with
prejudices&mdash;even with the one against the corpse-washer.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You needn't be afraid that you will be washed
once more.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Doesn't matter, either. One gets dirty
again.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Sprinkling him.</i>) It would call you back to
life again!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> We are mud.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I beg your pardon! I rub grease into myself
every day and then powder on top of it.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Probably worth while, too, on the dressed-up
mucker's account.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> It makes the skin like satin.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> As if it weren't just dirt all the same!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Thank you. I wish to be worth biting at!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> We are. Give a big dinner down below
there pretty soon. Keep open house.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Your guests will hardly over-eat themselves
at it.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Patience, girl! Your worshippers won't
put you in alcohol, either. It's "schöne Melusine" as long
as it keeps buoyant. Afterwards? They don't take it
at the zoölogical garden. (<i>Rising.</i>) The gentle beasties
might get stomach-cramps.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Getting up.</i>) Have you enough?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> There's still enough left over to plant
a juniper on my grave. I'll find my own way out. (<i>Exit.
Lulu follows him, and presently returns with Dr.&nbsp;Schön.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> What's your father doing here?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> If I were your husband that man would
never come over my threshold.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You can speak intimately. He's not here.
(<i>Referring to Schwarz.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Thank you, I'd rather not.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I don't understand.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I know that. (<i>Offering her a seat.</i>) I
should like to speak with you just on that subject.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Sitting down uncertainly.</i>) Why didn't you
tell me so yesterday, then?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Please, nothing now about yesterday. I did
tell you two years ago.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Nervously.</i>) Oh, yes,&mdash;Hm!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Please be kind enough to cease your visits
to my house.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> May I offer you an elixir&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Thanks. No elixir. Have you understood
me? (<i>Lulu shakes her head.</i>) Good. You have the
choice. You force me to the most extreme measures:&mdash;either
act in accordance with your station&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Or?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Or&mdash;you compel me&mdash;I should have to turn
to that person who is responsible for your behavior.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> What makes you imagine that?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I shall request your husband, himself to
watch over your ways. (<i>Lulu rises, goes up the steps,
right.</i>) Where are you going?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Calls thru the curtains.</i>) Walter!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Springing up.</i>) Are you mad?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Turning round.</i>) Aha!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I have made the most superhuman efforts
to raise you in society. You can be ten times as proud
of your name as of your intimacy with me.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Comes down the steps and puts her arm
around Schön's neck.</i>) Why are you still afraid, now
that you're at the zenith of your hopes?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> No comedy! The zenith of my hopes? I am
at last engaged: I have now the hope of bringing my bride
into a clean house.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Sitting.</i>) She has developed delightfully in
the two years!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> She no longer looks thru one so earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> She is now, for the first time, a woman. We
can meet each other wherever it seems suitable to you.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> We shall meet each other nowhere but in the
presence of your husband!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You don't believe yourself what you say.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Then <em>he</em> must believe it. Go on and call
him! Thru his marriage to you, thru all that I've done
for him, he has become my friend.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Rising.</i>) Mine, too.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Then I'll cut down the sword over my head.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You have, indeed, chained me up. But I owe
my happiness to you. You will get friends by the crowd
as soon as you have a pretty young wife again.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You judge women by yourself! He's got
the sense of a child or he would have tracked out your
doublings and windings long ago.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I only wish he would! Then, at last he'd get
out of his swaddling-clothes. He puts his trust in the
marriage contract he has in his pocket. Trouble is past
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a>] </span>and gone. One can now give oneself and let oneself
go as if one were at home. That isn't the sense of a
<em>child</em>! It's banal! He has no education; he sees
nothing; he sees neither me nor himself; he is blind,
blind, blind....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Half to himself.</i>) When <em>his</em> eyes open!!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Open his eyes for him! I'm going to ruin.
I'm neglecting myself. He doesn't know me at all.
What am I to him? He calls me darling and little
devil. He would say the same to any piano-teacher.
He makes no pretensions. Everything is alright, to him.
That comes from his never in his life having felt the need
of intercourse with women.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> If that's true!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He admits it perfectly openly.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> A man who has painted them, rags and tags
and velvet gowns, since he was fourteen.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Women make him anxious. He trembles for
his health and comfort. But he isn't afraid of <em>me</em>!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> How many girls would deem themselves
God knows how blessed in your situation.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Softly pleading.</i>) Seduce him. Corrupt
him. You know how. Take him into bad company&mdash;you
know the people. I am nothing to him but a woman,
just woman. He makes me feel so ridiculous. He will
be prouder of me. He doesn't know any differences.
I'm thinking my head off, day and night, how to shake
him up. In my despair I dance the can-can. He yawns;
and drivels something about obscenity.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Nonsense. He is an artist, though.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> At least he believes he is.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> That's the chief thing!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> When <em class="italic">I</em> pose for him.... He believes, too,
that he's a famous man.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> We <em>have</em> made him one.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He believes everything. He's as mistrustful as
a thief, and lets himself be lied to, till one loses all respect!
When we first knew each other I informed him
I had never yet loved&mdash; (<i>Schön falls into an easy-chair.</i>)
Otherwise he would really have taken me for a fallen
woman!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You make God knows what exorbitant demands
on <em>legitimate</em> relations!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I make no exorbitant demands. Often I even
dream still of Goll.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> He was, at any rate, not banal!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He is there, as if he had never been away.
Only he walks as tho in his socks. He isn't angry with
me; he's awfully sad. And then he is fearful, as tho
he were there without the permission of the police.
Otherwise, he feels at ease with us. Only he can't
quite get over my having thrown away so much money
since&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You yearn for the whip once more?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Maybe. I don't dance any more.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Teach him to do it.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> A waste of trouble.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Out of a hundred women, ninety educate
their husbands to suit themselves.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He loves me.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> That's fatal, of course.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He loves me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> That is an unbridgeable abyss.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He doesn't know me, but he loves me! If he
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a>] </span>had anything like a correct idea of me, he'd tie a stone
around my neck and sink me in the sea where it's deepest.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Let's finish this? (<i>He gets up.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> As you say.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I've married you off. Twice I have married
you off. You live in luxury. I've created a position for
your husband. If that doesn't satisfy you, and he laughs
in his sleeve at it, I don't pretend to meet ideal claims;
but&mdash;leave me out of the game, out of it!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Resolutely.</i>) If I belong to any person on
this earth, I belong to you. Without you I'd be&mdash;I won't
say where. You took me by the hand, gave me food to
eat, had me dressed,&mdash;when I was going to steal your
watch. Do you think that can be forgotten? Anybody
else would have called the police. You sent me to school,
and had me learn manners. Who but you in the whole
world has ever thought anything of me? I've danced
and posed, and was glad to be able to earn my living
that way. But <em>love</em> at command, I can't!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Raising his voice.</i>) Leave <em>me</em> out! Do
what you will. I'm not coming to make scandal; I'm
coming to shake the scandal from my neck. My engagement
is costing me sacrifices enough! I had imagined
that with a healthy young man, than whom a woman of
your years can wish herself no better, you would, at last,
have been contented. If you are under obligations to me,
don't throw yourself a third time in my way! Am I to
wait yet longer before putting my pile in security? Am
I to risk the whole success of my patents falling into the
water again after two years? What good is it to me
to be your married-man, when <em>you</em> can be seen going
in and out of my house at every hour of the day? Why
the devil didn't Dr.&nbsp;Goll stay alive just one year more!
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a>] </span>With him you were in safe keeping. Then I'd have had
my wife long since under my roof!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> And what would you have had then? The
kid gets on your nerves. The child is too uncorrupted
for you. She's been much too carefully brought up.
What should I have against your marriage? But you are
deceived about yourself if you think that on account of
your impending marriage you may express your contempt
to me.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Contempt? I shall soon give the child the
right idea. If anything is contemptible, it's your intrigues!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Laughing.</i>) Am I jealous of the child?
That never once entered my head.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Then why talk about the child? The child
is not even a whole year younger than you are. Leave
me my freedom to live what life I still have. No matter
how the child's been brought up, she's got her five senses
just like you.... (<i>Schwarz appears, right, brush in
hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> What's the matter here?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>To Schön.</i>) Well? Go on. Talk.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> What's the matter with you two?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Nothing that touches you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Sharply.</i>) Quiet!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He's had enough of me. (<i>Schwarz leads her
off, to the right.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Turning over the leaves in one of the books

hands free at last!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Not a penny.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Explain to me the peculiar scene....</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You have married half a million&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> No one can make a crime of that.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You have created a name for yourself. You
can work unmolested. You need to deny yourself no
wish&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> What have you two got against me?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> For six months you've been revelling in all
the heavens. You have a wife whom the world envies
you, and she deserves a man whom she can respect&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Doesn't she respect me?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Depressed.</i>) I come from the dark
depths of society. She is above me. I cherish no more
ardent wish than to become her equal. (<i>Offers Schön
his hand.</i>) Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Pressing it, half embarrassed.</i>) Don't mention it.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>With determination.</i>) Speak!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Keep a little more watch on her.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I&mdash;on her?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> We are not children! We don't trifle! She
demands that she be taken seriously. Her value gives her

each other very seriously here.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Evasive.</i>) &mdash;I don't come here to make
scandal, I come to save you from the scandal.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> You have misunderstood her.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Embarrassed.</i>) That will not do for me.
I can't see you go on living in blindness. The girl deserves
to be a respectable woman. Since I have known
her she has improved as she developed.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Since you have known her? Since when
have you known her then?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Since about her twelfth year.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Bewildered.</i>) She told me nothing about
that.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> She sold flowers in front of the Alhambra
Café. Every evening between twelve and two she pressed
in among the guests, bare-footed.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> She told me nothing of that.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> She did right there. I'm telling you, so
you may see that you have not to do with moral degeneracy.
The girl is, on the contrary, of extraordinarily
good disposition.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> She said she had grown up with an aunt.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> That was the woman I gave her to. She
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a>] </span>was her best pupil. The mothers used to make her an
example to their children. She has the feeling for duty.
It is simply and solely your mistake if you have till now
neglected to take her on her best sides.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Sobbing.</i>) O God!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>With emphasis.</i>) No O God!! Nothing
of the happiness you have cost can be changed. Done is
done. You over-rate yourself against your better knowledge
if you persuade yourself you will lose. You stand
to gain. But with "O God" nothing is gained. A greater
friendliness I have not yet shown you: I speak plainly and
offer you my help. Don't show yourself unworthy of it!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>From now on more and more broken
up.</i>) When I first knew her, she told me she had never
loved.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> When a widow says that&mdash;! It does her
credit that she chose you for a husband. Make the same
claims on yourself and your happiness is without a blot.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> She says he made her wear short dresses.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> But he married her! That was her master-stroke.
How she brought the man to it is beyond me.
You really must know it now: you are enjoying the fruits
of her diplomacy.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> How did she get to know Dr.&nbsp;Goll then?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Through me! It was after my wife's death,
when I was making the first advances to my present
fiancée. She stuck herself in between. She had fixed
her mind on becoming my wife.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>As if seized with a horrible suspicion.</i>)
And then when her husband died?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You married half a million!!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Wailing.</i>) O, to have stayed where I
was! To have died of hunger!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Superior.</i>) Do you think, then, that <em class="italic">I</em> make
no compromises? Who is there that does not compromise?
You have married half a million. You are to-day
one of the foremost artists. That can't be done
without money. You are not the man to sit in judgment
on her. You can't possibly treat an origin like Mignon's
according to the notions of bourgeois society.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Quite distraught.</i>) Who are you speaking
of?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Of her father! You're an artist, I say: your
ideals are on a different plane from those of a wage-worker.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I don't understand a word of all that.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I am speaking of the inhuman conditions out
of which, thanks to her good management, the girl has
developed into what she is!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Who?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Who? Your wife.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> <em>Eve?</em></p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I called her Mignon.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I thought her name was Nellie?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Dr.&nbsp;Goll called her so.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I called her Eve&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> What her real name is I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Absently.</i>) Perhaps she knows.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> With a father like hers, she is, with all her
faults, a miracle. I don't understand you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> He died in a madhouse&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> He was here just now!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Who was here?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Her father.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Here&mdash;in my house?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> He squeezed by me as I came in. And there
are the two glasses still.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> She says he died in the madhouse.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Let her feel she's in authority&mdash;! She craves
nothing but the compulsion to unconditional obedience.
With Dr.&nbsp;Goll she was in heaven, and with him there
was no joking.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Shaking his head.</i>) She said she had
never loved&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> But you, make a beginning with yourself.
Pull yourself together!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> She has sworn&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You can't demand a sense of duty in her
before you know your own task.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> By her mother's grave!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> She never knew her mother, let alone the
grave. Her mother hasn't got a grave.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> I don't fit in society. (<i>He is in desperation.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> Pain&mdash;horrible pain!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Gets up, steps back; after a pause.</i>) Guard
her for yourself: she's yours. The moment is decisive.
To-morrow she may be lost to you.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Pointing to his breast.</i>) Here, here.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You have married half&mdash; (<i>Reflecting.</i>) She
is lost to you if you let this moment slip!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> If I could weep! Oh, if I could cry out!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>With a hand on his shoulder.</i>) You're suffering&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> (<i>Getting up, apparently quiet.</i>) You are
right, quite right.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Gripping his hand.</i>) Where are you going?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHWARZ.</span> To speak with her.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Right! (<i>Accompanies him to the door, left.
Coming back.</i>) That was tough work. (<i>After a pause,
looking right.</i>) He had taken her into the studio before
though? (<i>A fearful groan, left. He hurries to the door
and finds it locked.</i>) Open! Open the door!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Stepping thru the hangings, right.</i>) What's&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Open it!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Comes down the steps.</i>) That is horrible.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Have you an ax in the kitchen?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He'll open it right off&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I can't kick it down.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> When he's had his cry out.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Kicking the door.</i>) Open! (<i>To Lulu.</i>)
Bring me an ax.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Send for the doctor&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You are not yourself.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> It serves you right. (<i>Bell rings in the corridor.
Schön and Lulu stare at each other. Then
Schön slips up-stage and stands in the doorway.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I mustn't let myself be seen here.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Perhaps it's the art-dealer. (<i>The bell rings
again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> But if we don't answer it&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Steals toward the door; but Schön holds
her.</i><a name="steals" id="steals"></a><ins class='correction' title=')&mdash;'>)&nbsp;&mdash;</ins></p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Stop. It sometimes happens that one is not
just at hand&mdash; (<i>He goes out on tip-toes. Lulu turns
back to the locked door and listens. Schön returns with
Alva.</i>) Please be quiet.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Very excited.</i>) A revolution has broken out
in Paris!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Be quiet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a>] </span><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) You're as pale as death.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Rattling at the door.</i>) Walter! Walter!
(<i>A death-rattle heard behind the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> God pity you.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Haven't you brought an ax?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> If there's one there&mdash; (<i>Goes slowly out, upper
left.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> He's just keeping us in suspense.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> A revolution has broken out in Paris?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> In the editors' room they're beating their heads
against the wall. No one knows what he ought to write.
(<i>The bell rings in the corridor.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Kicking against the door.</i>) Walter!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Shall I force it in?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I can do that. Who is it coming now?
(<i>Standing up.</i>) To enjoy life and let others be responsible
for it&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Coming back with a kitchen ax.</i>) Henriette
has come home.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Shut the door behind you.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Give it here. (<i>Takes the ax and pounds with
it between the jamb and the lock.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You must hold it nearer the end.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> It's cracking&mdash; (<i>The lock gives; Alva lets
the ax fall and staggers back.</i>) (<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>To Schön, pointing to the door.</i>) After
you. (<i>Schön flinches, drops back.</i>) Are you getting&mdash;dizzy?
(<i>Schön wipes the sweat from his forehead and
goes in.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>From the couch.</i>) Ghastly!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Stopping in the door-way, finger on lips, cries
out sharply.</i>) Oh! Oh! (<i>Hurries to Alva.</i>) I can't
stay here.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a>] </span><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Horrible!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Taking his hand.</i>) Come.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Where to?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I can't be alone. (<i>Goes out with Alva, right.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Schön comes back, a bunch of keys in his hand, which
shows blood. He pulls the door to, behind him, goes to
the writing-table, opens it, and writes two notes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Coming back, right.</i>) She's changing her
clothes.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> She has gone?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> To her room. She's changing her clothes.
(<i>Schön rings. Henriette comes in.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You know where Dr.&nbsp;Bernstein lives?</p>

<p><span class="small">HENRIETTE.</span> Of course, Doctor. Right next door.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Giving her one note.</i>) Take that over to
him, please.</p>

<p><span class="small">HENRIETTE.</span> In case the doctor is not at home?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> He is at home. (<i>Giving her the other note.</i>)
And take this to police headquarters. Take a cab. (<i>Henriette
goes out.</i>) I am judged!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> My blood is cold.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Toward the left.</i>) The fool!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> He waked up to something, perhaps?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> He has been too absorbed with himself.
(<i>Lulu appears on the steps, right, in dust-coat and hat.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Where are you going now?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Out. I see it on all the walls.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Where are his papers?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> In the desk.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>At the desk.</i>) Where?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Lower right-hand drawer. (<i>She kneels and
opens the drawer, emptying the papers on the floor.</i>)
Here. There is nothing to fear. He had no secrets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Now I can just withdraw from the world.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Still kneeling.</i>) Write a pamphlet about
him. Call him Michelangelo.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> What good'll that do? (<i>Pointing left.</i>)
There lies my engagement.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> That's the curse of your game!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Shout it thru the streets!!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Pointing to Lulu.</i>) If you had treated that
girl fairly and justly when my mother died&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> My engagement is bleeding to death there!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Getting up.</i>) I sha'n't stay here any longer.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> In an hour they'll be selling extras. I dare
not go across the street!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Why, what can you do to help it?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> That's just it! They'll stone me for it!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You must get away&mdash;travel.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> To leave the scandal a free field!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>By the couch.</i>) Ten minutes ago he was
lying here.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> This is the reward for all I've done for him!
In one second he wrecks my whole life for me!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Control yourself, please!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>On the couch.</i>) There's no one but ourselves
here.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> But <em>our</em> position?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) What will you say to the
police?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> He didn't want to remain a debtor to his destiny.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He always thought of death immediately.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> He thought what a human being can only
dream of.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> He has paid dearly for it.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> He had what <em>we</em> don't have!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Suddenly violent.</i>) I know your reasons!
I have no cause to consider you! If you try every means
to prevent having any brothers and sisters, that's all the
more reason why I should get more children.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You've a poor knowledge of men.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You get out an extra yourself!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>With passionate indignation.</i>) He had no
moral sense! (<i>Suddenly controlling himself again.</i>)
Paris in revolution&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Our editors act as though they'd been struck.
Everything has stopped dead.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> That's got to help me over this! Now if
only the police would come. The minutes are worth
more than gold. (<i>The bell rings in the corridor.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> There they are&mdash; (<i>Schön starts to the door.
Lulu jumps up.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Wait, you've got blood&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Where?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Wait, I'll wipe it. (<i>Sprinkles her handkerchief
with heliotrope and wipes the blood from Schön's
hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> It's your husband's blood.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> It leaves no trace.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Monster!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You will marry me, though. (<i>The bell rings

goes out and returns with Escherich, a reporter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCHERICH.</span> (<i>Breathless.</i>) Allow me to&mdash;to introduce myself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You've run?</p>

<h2>ACT III</h2>


<p><i>A theatrical dressing-room, hung with red. Door upper
right. Across upper left corner, a Spanish screen. Centre,
a table set endwise, on which dance costumes lie.
Chair on each side of this table. Lower right, a smaller
table with a chair. Lower left, a high, very wide, old-fashioned
arm-chair. Above it, a tall mirror, with a make-up
stand before it holding puff, rouge, etc., etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Alva is at lower right, filling two glasses with red wine
and champagne.</i></p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Never since I began to work for the stage have
I seen a public so uncontrolled in enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Voice from behind the screen.</i>) Don't give
me too much red wine. Will he see me to-day?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Father?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I don't know if he's in the theater.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Doesn't he want to see me at all?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> He has so little time.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> His <em>bride</em> occupies him.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Speculations. He gives himself no rest.
(<i>Schön enters.</i>) You? We're just speaking of you.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Is he there?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You're changing?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Peeping over the Spanish screen, to Schön.</i>)
You write in all the papers that I'm the most gifted
danseuse who ever trod the stage, a second Taglioni and
I don't know what else&mdash;and you haven't once found me
gifted enough to convince yourself of the fact.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I have so much to write. You see, I was
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a>] </span>right: there were hardly any seats left. You must keep
rather more in the proscenium.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I must first accustom myself to the light.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> She has kept herself strictly to her part.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>To Alva.</i>) You must get more out of
your performers! You don't know enough yet about
the technique. (<i>To Lulu.</i>) What do you come as now?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> As a flower-girl.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>To Alva.</i>) In tights?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> No. In a skirt to the ankles.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> It would have been better if you hadn't ventured
on symbolism.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I look at a dancer's feet.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> The point is, what the public looks at. An
apparition like <em>her</em> has no need, thank heaven, of your
symbolic mummery.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> The public doesn't look as if it was bored!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Of course not; because I have been working
for her success in the press for six months. Has the
prince been here?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Nobody's been here.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Who lets a dancer come on thru two acts
in raincoats?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Who is the prince?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Shall we see each other afterwards?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Are you alone?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> With acquaintances. At Peter's?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> At twelve?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> At twelve. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I'd given up hoping he'd ever come.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Don't let yourself be misled by his grumpy
growls. If you'll only be careful not to spend your
strength before the last number begins&mdash; (<i>Lulu steps
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a>] </span>out in a classical, sleeveless dress, white with a red border,
a bright wreath in her hair and a basket of flowers in her
hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He doesn't seem to have noticed at all how
cleverly you have used your performers.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I won't blow in sun, moon and stars in the
first act!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Sipping.</i>) You disclose me by degrees.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I knew, though, that you knew all about changing
costumes.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> If I'd wanted to sell my flowers this way before
the Alhambra café, they'd have had me behind lock
and key right off the very first night.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Why? You were a child!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Do you remember me when I entered your
room the first time?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You wore a dark blue dress with black velvet.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> They had to stick me somewhere and didn't
know where.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> My mother had been lying sick two years then.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You were playing theater, and asked me if I
wanted to play too.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> To be sure! We played theater!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I see you still&mdash;the way you shoved the figures
back and forth.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> For a long time my most terrible memory
was when all at once I saw clearly into your relations&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You got icy curt towards me then.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Oh, <a name="i" id="i"></a><ins class='correction' title='God&mdash; I'>God&mdash;I</ins> saw in you something so infinitely
far above me. I had perhaps a higher devotion to you
than to my mother. Think&mdash;when my mother died&mdash;I
was seventeen&mdash;I went and stood before my father and
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a>] </span>demanded that he make you his wife on the spot or we'd
have to fight a duel.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He told me that at the time.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Since I've grown older, I can only pity him.
He will never comprehend me. There he is making up
a story for himself about a little diplomatic game that
puts me in the rôle of laboring against his marriage with
the Countess.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Does she still look as innocently as ever at the
world?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> She loves him. I'm convinced of that. Her
family has tried everything to make her turn back. I
don't think any sacrifice in the world would be too great
for her for his sake.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Holds out her glass to him.</i>) A little more,
please.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Giving it to her.</i>) You're drinking too much.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He shall learn to believe in my success! He
doesn't believe in any art. He believes only in papers.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> He believes in nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He brought me into the theater in order that
someone might eventually be found rich enough to marry
me.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Well, alright. Why need that trouble us?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I am to be glad if I can dance myself into a millionaire's
heart.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> God defend that anyone should take you from
us!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You've composed the music for it, though.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You know that it was always my wish to write
a piece for you.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I am not at all made for the stage, however.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You came into the world a dancer!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> Why don't you write your things at least as
interesting as life is?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Because if we did no man would believe us.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> If I didn't know more about acting than the
people on the stage do, what might not have happened
to me?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I've provided your part with all the impossibilities
imaginable, though.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> With hocus-pocus like that no dog is lured
from the stove in the real world.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> It's enough for me that the public finds itself
most tremendously stirred up.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> But <em class="italic">I</em>'d like to find myself most tremendously
stirred up. (<i>Drinks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You don't seem to be in need of much more for
that.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> No one of them realizes anything about the
others. Each thinks that he alone is the unhappy victim.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> But how can you feel that?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> There runs up one's body such an icy shudder.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You are incredible. (<i>An electric bell rings over
the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> My cape.... I shall keep in the proscenium!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Putting a wide shawl round her shoulders.</i>)
Here is your cape.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He shall have nothing more to fear for his
shameless boosting.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Keep yourself under control!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> God grant that I dance the last sparks of intelligence
out of their heads. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Yes, a more interesting piece could be written
about her. (<i>Sits, right, and takes out his note-book.
Writes. Looks up.</i>) First act: Dr.&nbsp;Goll. Rotten already!
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a>] </span>I can call up Dr.&nbsp;Goll from purgatory or wherever
else he's doing penance for his orgies, but I'll be made
responsible for his sins. (<i>Long-continued but much
deadened applause and bravos outside.</i>) They rage there
as in a menagery when the meat appears at the cage.
Second act: Walter Schwarz. Still more impossible!
How our souls do strip off their last coverings in the
light of such lightning-strokes! Third act? Is it really
to go on this way? (<i>The attendant opens the door from
outside and lets Escerny enter. He acts as though he were
at home, and without greeting Alva takes the chair near
the mirror. Alva continues, not heeding him.</i>) It can
not go on this way in the third act!</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> Up to the middle of the third act it didn't
seem to go so well to-day as usual.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I was not on the stage.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> Now she's in full career again.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> She's lengthening each number.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> I once had the pleasure of meeting the
artiste at Schön's.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> My father has brought her before the public
by some critiques in his paper.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> (<i>Bowing slightly.</i>) I was conferring with
Dr.&nbsp;Schön about the publication of my discoveries at Lake
Tanganika.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Bowing slightly.</i>) His remarks leave no doubt
that he takes the liveliest interest in your work.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> It's a very good thing in the artiste that the
<em>public</em> does not exist for her at all.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> As a child she learned the quick changing of
clothes; but I was surprised to discover such an expressive
dancer in her.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> When she dances her solo she is intoxicated
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a>] </span>with her own beauty, with which she herself seems to be
mortally in love.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Here she comes. (<i>Gets up and opens the door.
Enter Lulu.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Without wreath or basket, to Alva.</i>) You're
called for. I was three times before the curtain. (<i>To
Escerny.</i>) Dr.&nbsp;Schön is not in your box?</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> Not in mine.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) Didn't you see him?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He is probably away again.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> He has the last parquet-box on the left.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> It seems he is ashamed of me!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> There wasn't a good seat left for him.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>To Alva.</i>) Ask him, though, if he likes me
better now.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I'll send him up.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> He applauded.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Did he really?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Give yourself some rest. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I've got to change again now.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> But your maid isn't here?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I can do it quicker alone. Where did you say
Dr.&nbsp;Schön was sitting?</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> I saw him in the left parquet-box farthest
back.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I've still five costumes before me now; dancing-girl,
ballerina, queen of the night, Ariel, and Lascaris....
(<i>She goes behind the Spanish screen.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> Would you think it possible that at our first
meeting I expected nothing more than to make the acquaintance
of a young lady of the literary world?...
(<i>He sits at the left of the centre table, and remains there
to the end of the scene.</i>) Have I perhaps erred in my
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a>] </span>judgment of your nature, or did I rightly interpret the
smile which the thundering storms of applause called forth
on your lips? That you are secretly pained at the necessity
of profaning your art before people of doubtful disinterestedness?
(<i>Lulu makes no answer.</i>) That you
would gladly exchange at any moment the shimmer of
publicity for a quiet, sunny happiness in distinguished seclusion?
(<i>Lulu makes no answer.</i>) That you feel in
yourself enough dignity and high rank to fetter a man to
your feet&mdash;in order to enjoy his utter helplessness?...
(<i>Lulu makes no answer.</i>) That in a comfortable, richly
furnished villa you would feel in a more fitting place than
here,&mdash;with unlimited means, to live completely as your
<em>own mistress</em>? (<i>Lulu steps forth in a short, bright,
pleated petticoat and white satin bodice, black shoes and
stockings, and spurs with bells at her heels.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Busy with the lacing of her bodice.</i>) If
there's just one evening I don't go on, I dream the whole
night that I'm dancing and feel the next day as if I'd been
racked.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> But what difference could it make to you
to see before you instead of this mob <em>one</em> spectator,
specially elect?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> That would make no difference. I don't see
anybody anyway.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> A lighted summer-house&mdash;the splashing of
the water near at hand.... I am forced in my exploring-trips
to the practise of a quite inhuman tyranny&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Putting on a pearl necklace before the mirror.</i>)
A good school!</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> And if I now long to deliver myself unreservedly
into the power of a woman, that is a natural
need for relaxation.... Can you imagine a greater life-happiness
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a>] </span>for a woman than to have a man entirely in her
power?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Jingling her heels.</i>) Oh yes!</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> (<i>Disconcerted.</i>) Among cultured men you
will find not one who doesn't lose his head over you.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Your wishes, however, no one will fulfill without
deceiving you.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> To be deceived by a girl like you must be
ten times more enrapturing than to be uprightly loved by
anybody else.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You have never in your life been uprightly
loved by a girl! (<i>Turning her back to him and pointing.</i>)
Would you undo this knot for me? I've laced myself
too tight. I am always so excited getting dressed.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> (<i>After repeated efforts.</i>) I'm sorry; I can't.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Then leave it. Perhaps I can. (<i>Goes left.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> I confess that I am lacking in deftness.
Maybe I was not docile enough with women.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> And probably you don't have much opportunity
to be so in Africa, either?</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> (<i>Seriously.</i>) Let me openly admit to you
that my loneliness in the world embitters many hours.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> The knot is almost done....</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> What draws me to you is not your dancing.
It's your physical and mental refinement, as it is revealed
in every one of your movements. Anyone who is so much
interested in art as I am could not be deceived in that.
For ten evenings I've been studying your spiritual life in
your dance, until to-day when you entered as the flower-girl
I became perfectly clear. Yours is a grand nature&mdash;unselfish;
you can see no one suffer; you embody the joy
of life. As a wife you will make a man happy above all
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a>] </span>things.... You are all open-heartedness. You would
be a poor actor. (<i>The bell rings again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Having somewhat loosened her laces, takes a
deep breath and jingles her spurs.</i>) Now I can breathe
again. The curtain is going up. (<i>She takes from the
centre table a skirt-dance costume&mdash;of bright yellow silk,
without a waist, closed at the neck, reaching to the ankles,
with wide, loose sleeves&mdash;and throws it over her.</i>) I must
dance.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> (<i>Rises and kisses her hand.</i>) Allow me to
remain here a little while longer.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Please, stay.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> I need some solitude. (<i>Lulu goes out.</i>)
What is to be aristocratic? To be eccentric, like me?
Or to be perfect in body and mind, like this girl? (<i>Applause
and bravos outside.</i>) He who gives me back my
faith in men, gives me back my life. Should not the
children of this woman be more princely, body and soul,
than the children whose mother has no more vitality in
her than I have felt in me until to-day? (<i>Sitting, right;
ecstatically.</i>) The dance has ennobled her body....
(<i>Alva enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> One is never sure a moment that some miserable
chance may not throw the whole performance out
for good. (<i>He throws himself into the big chair, left, so
that the two men are in exactly reversed positions from
their former ones. Both converse somewhat boredly and
apathetically.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> But the public has never yet shown itself
so grateful.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> She's finished the skirt-dance.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> I hear her coming....</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a>] </span><span class="small">ALVA.</span> She isn't coming. She has no time. She
changes her costume in the wings.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> She has two ballet-costumes, if I'm not mistaken?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I find the white one more becoming to her than
the rose.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> Do you?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Don't you?</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> I find she looks too body-less in the white
tulle.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I find she looks too animal in the rose-tulle.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> I don't find that.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> The white tulle expresses more the child-like
in her nature.</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> The rose tulle expresses more the female in
her nature. (<i>The electric bell rings over the door. Alva
jumps up.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> For heaven's sake, what is wrong?</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> (<i>Getting up too</i><a name="stop" id="stop"></a><ins class='correction' title=').'><i>.</i>)</ins> What's the matter?
(<i>The electric bell goes on ringing to the close of the
dialogue.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Something's gone wrong there&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">ESCERNY.</span> How can you get so suddenly frightened?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> That must be a hellish confusion! (<i>He runs
out. Escerny follows him. The door remains open.
Faint dance-music heard. Pause. Lulu enters in a long
cloak, and shuts the door to behind her. She wears a
rose-colored ballet costume with flower garlands. She
walks across the stage and sits down in the big arm-chair
near the mirror. After a pause Alva returns.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You had a faint?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Please lock the door.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> At least come down to the stage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> Did you see him?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> See whom?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> With his bride?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> With his&mdash; (<i>To Schön, who enters.</i>) You
might have spared yourself that jest!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> What's the matter with her? (<i>To Lulu.</i>)
How can you play the scene straight at me!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I feel as if I'd been whipped.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>After bolting the door.</i>) You will dance&mdash;as
sure as I've taken the responsibility for you!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Before your bride?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Have you a right to trouble yourself before
whom? You've been engaged here. You receive your
salary&nbsp;...</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Is that your affair?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You dance for anyone who buys a ticket.
Whom I sit with in my box has nothing to do with your
business!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I wish you'd stayed sitting in your box! (<i>To
Lulu.</i>) Tell me, please, what I am to do. (<i>A knock at
the door.</i>) There is the manager. (<i>Calls.</i>) Yes, in a
moment! (<i>To Lulu.</i>) You won't compel us to break
off the performance?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>To Lulu.</i>) Onto the stage with you!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Let me have just a moment! I can't now.
I'm utterly miserable.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> The devil take the whole theater crowd!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Put in the next number. No one will notice
if I dance now or in five minutes. There's no strength
in my feet.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> But you will dance then?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> As well as I can.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a>] </span><span class="small">ALVA.</span> As badly as you like. (<i>A knock at the door
again.</i>) I'm coming.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>When Alva is gone.</i>) You are right to show
me where my place is. You couldn't do it better than by
letting me dance the skirt-dance before your fiancée....
You do me the greatest service when you point out where
I belong.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Sardonically.</i>) For you with your origin
it's incomparable luck to still have the chance of entering
before respectable people!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Even when my shamelessness makes them not
know where to look.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Nonsense!&mdash;Shamelessness?&mdash;Don't make a
necessity of virtue! Your shamelessness is balanced with
gold for you at every step. One cries "bravo," another
"fie"&mdash;it's all the same to you! Can you wish for
a more brilliant triumph than when a respectable girl can
hardly be kept in the box? Has your life any other aim?
As long as you still have a spark of self-respect, you are no
perfect dancer. The more terribly you make people shudder,
the higher you stand in your profession!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> But it is absolutely indifferent to me what they
think of me. I don't, in the least, want to be any better
than I am. I'm content with myself.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>In moral indignation.</i>) That is your true
nature. I call that straightforward! A corruption!!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I wouldn't have known that I had a spark of
self-respect&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Suddenly distrustful.</i>) No harlequinading&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> O Lord&mdash;I know very well what I'd have become
if you hadn't saved me from it.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Are you then, perhaps, something different to-day?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> God be thanked, no!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> That is right!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) And how awfully glad I am about
it.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Spits.</i>) Will you dance now?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> In anything, before anyone!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Then down to the stage!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Begging like a child.</i>) Just a minute more!
Please! I can't stand up straight yet. They'll ring.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You have become what you are in spite of
everything I sacrificed for your education and your welfare.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Had you overrated your ennobling influence?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Spare me your witticisms.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> The prince was here.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He takes me with him to Africa.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Africa?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Why not? Didn't you make me a dancer just
so that someone might come and take me away with him?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> But not to Africa, though!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Then why didn't you let me fall quietly in a
faint, and silently thank heaven for it?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Because, more's the pity, I had no reason for
believing in your faint!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Making fun of him.</i>) You couldn't bear it
any longer out there?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Because I had to bring home to you what you
are and to whom you are not to look up.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You were afraid, though, that my legs might
have been seriously injured?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I know too well you are indestructible.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> So you know that?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Bursting out.</i>) Don't look at me so impudently!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> No one is keeping you here.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I'm going as soon as the bell rings.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> As soon as you have the energy! Where is
your energy? You have been engaged three years. Why
don't you marry? You recognize no obstacles. Why do
you want to put the blame on me? You ordered me to
marry Dr.&nbsp;Goll: I forced Dr.&nbsp;Goll to marry me. You
ordered me to marry the painter: I made the best of a
bad bargain. Artists are your creatures, princes your
protegés. Why don't you marry?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Raging.</i>) Do you imagine <em>you</em> stand in
the way?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>From here to the end of the act triumphant.</i>)
If you knew how happy your rage is making me! How
proud I am that you should humble me by every means
in your power! You debase me as deep&mdash;as deep as a
woman can be debased, for you hope you can then jump
over me easier. But you have suffered unspeakably yourself
from everything you just said to me. I see it in you.
Already you are near the end of your self-command. Go!
For your innocent fiancée's sake, leave me alone! One
minute more, your mood will change around and you'll
make a scene with me of another kind, that you can't
answer for now.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I fear you no longer.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Me? Fear yourself! I do not need you. I
beg you to go! Don't give me the blame. You know
I don't need to faint to destroy your future. You have
unlimited confidence in my honorableness. You believe
not only that I'm an ensnaring daughter of Eve; you
believe, too, that I'm a very good-natured creature. I am
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a>] </span>neither the one nor the other. Your misfortune is only
that you think I am.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Desperate.</i>) Leave my thoughts alone!
You have two men under the sod. Take the prince,
dance him into the earth! I am thru with you. I know
when the angel in you stops off and the devil begins. If
I take the world as it's made, the Creator must be responsible,
not I! To me life is not an amusement!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> And, therefore, you make claims on life greater
than anyone can make. Tell me, who of us two is more
full of claims and demands, you or I?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Be silent! I don't know how or what I think.
When I hear you, I don't think any more. In a week
I'll be married. I conjure you, by the angel that is in
you, during that time come no more to my sight!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I will lock my doors.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Go on and boast! God knows since I've been
wrestling with the world and with life I have cursed no
one like you!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> That comes from my lowly origin.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> From your depravity!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> With a thousand pleasures I take the blame
on myself! You must feel clean now; you must think
yourself a model of austerity now, a paragon of unflinching
principle! Otherwise you could never marry the child
in her boundless inexperience&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Do you want me to grab you and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Yes! What must I say to make you? Not
for the world would I change with the innocent kid now!
Tho the girl loves you as no woman has ever loved you
yet!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Silence, beast! Silence!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> Marry her&mdash;and then she'll dance in her childish
wretchedness before <em>my</em> eyes, instead of I before hers!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Raising his fists.</i>) God forgive me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Strike me! Where is your riding-whip? Strike
me on the legs&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Grasping his temples.</i>) Away, away!
(<i>Rushes to the door, recollects himself, turns around.</i>)
Can I go before the girl now, this way? Home!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Be a man! Look yourself in the face once:&mdash;you
have no trace of a conscience; you are frightened
at no wickedness; in the most cold-blooded way you mean
to make the girl that loves you unhappy; you conquer
half the world; you do what you please;&mdash;and you know
as well as I that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Sunk in the chair, right centre, utterly exhausted.</i>)
Stop!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> That you are too weak&mdash;to tear yourself away
from me.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Groaning.</i>) Oh! Oh! You make me
weep.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> This moment makes <em>me</em> I cannot tell you
how glad.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> My age! My position!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He cries like a child&mdash;the terrible man of
might! Now go so to your bride and tell her what kind
of a girl I am at heart&mdash;not a bit jealous!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Sobbing.</i>) The child! The innocent child!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> How can the incarnate devil get so weak all
of a sudden! But now go, please. You are nothing more
now to me.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I cannot go to her.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Out with you. Come back to me when you
have regained your strength again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Tell me in God's name what I must do.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Gets up; her cloak remains on the chair.
Shoving aside the costumes on the centre table.</i>) Here is
writing-paper&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I can't write....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Upright behind him, her arm on the back of
his chair.</i>) Write! "My dear young lady<a name="lady" id="lady"></a><ins class='correction' title='.. ..'>....</ins>"</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Hesitating.</i>) I call her Adelheid&nbsp;...</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>With emphasis.</i>) "My dear young lady&nbsp;..."</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> My sentence of death! (<i>He writes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> "Take back your promise. I cannot reconcile
it with my conscience&mdash;" (<i>Schön drops the pen and glances
up at her entreatingly.</i>) Write conscience!&mdash;"to fasten
you to my unhappy lot...."</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Writing.</i>) You are right. You are right.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> "I give you my word that I am unworthy of
your love&mdash;" (<i>Schön turns round again.</i>) Write love!
"These lines are the proof of it. For three years I have
tried to tear myself loose; I have not the strength. I am
writing you by the side of the woman that commands me.
Forget me. Dr.&nbsp;Ludwig Schön."</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Groaning.</i>) O God!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Half startled.</i>) No, no O God! (<i>With emphasis.</i>)
"Dr.&nbsp;Ludwig Schön." Postscript: "Do not attempt
to save me."</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Having written to the end, quite collapses.</i>)
Now&mdash;comes the&mdash;execution.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a>] </span></p>
<h2>ACT IV</h2>


<p><i>A splendid hall in German Renaissance style, with a
thick floor of oak-blocks. The lower half of the walls
of dark carved wood; the upper half on both sides hung
with faded Gobelins. At rear, a curtained gallery from
which a monumental stair-case leads, right, half-way down
the stage. At centre, under the gallery, the entrance-door,
with twisted posts and pediment. At left, a high and
spacious fire-place with a Chinese folding screen before it.
Further down, left, a French window onto a balcony,
with heavy curtains, closed. Down right, door hung with
Genoese velvet. Near it, a broad ottoman, with a chair
on its left. Behind, near the foot of the stairs, Lulu's Pierrot-picture
on a decorative stand and in a gold frame made
to look antique. In the centre of the hall, a heavy square
table, with three high-backed upholstered chairs round it
and a vase of white flowers on it.</i></p>

<p><i>Countess Geschwitz sits on the ottoman, in a soldier-like,
fur-trimmed waist, high, upright collar, enormous cuff-links,
a veil over her face and her hands clasped convulsively
in her muff. Schön stands down right. Lulu,
in a big-flowered morning-dress, her hair in a simple knot
in a golden circlet, sits in the arm-chair left of the ottoman.</i></p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> You can't think how glad I shall be to see
you at our artists' ball. (<i>To Lulu.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Is there no sort of possibility of a person like
me smuggling in?</p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> It would be high treason if any of us lent
herself to such an intrigue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Crossing to the centre table, behind the ottoman.</i>)
The glorious flowers!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Fr&auml;ulein von Geschwitz brought me those.</p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> Don't mention it. Oh, you'll be in man's
costume, won't you?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Do you think that becomes me?</p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> You're a dream here. (<i>Signifying the
picture.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> My husband doesn't like it.</p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> Is it by a local man?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You will hardly have known him.</p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> No longer living?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Down left, with a deep voice.</i>) He had
enough.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You're in bad temper. (<i>Schön controls himself.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>Getting up.</i>) I must go, Mrs. Schön.
I can't stay any longer. This evening we have life-class,
and I have still so much to get ready for the ball.
Good-bye, Dr.&nbsp;Schön. (<i>Exit, up-stage. Lulu accompanies
her. Schön looks around him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Pure Augean stable. That, the end of my life.
They ought to show me a corner that's still clean. The
pest in the house. The poorest day-laborer has his tidy
nest. Thirty years' work, and this my family circle, the
circle of my people&mdash; (<i>Glancing round.</i>) God knows
who is overhearing me again now! (<i>Draws a revolver
from his breast pocket.</i>) Man is, indeed, uncertain of his
life! (<i>The cocked revolver in his right hand, he goes
left and speaks at the closed window curtains.</i>) That,
my family circle! The fellow still has courage! Shall I
not rather shoot <em>myself</em> in the head? Against deadly
enemies one fights, but the&mdash; (<i>Throws up the curtains,
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a>] </span>but finds no one hidden behind them.</i>) The dirt&mdash;the
dirt.... (<i>Shakes his head and crosses right.</i>) Insanity
has already conquered my reason, or else&mdash;exceptions prove
the rule! (<i>Hearing Lulu coming he puts the revolver
back in his pocket. Lulu comes down right.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Couldn't you get away for this afternoon?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Just what did that Countess want?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I don't know. She wants to paint me.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Misfortune in human guise, that waits upon
one.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Couldn't you get away, then? I would so
like to drive thru the grounds with you.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Just the day when I must be at the exchange.
You know that I'm not free to-day. All my property
is drifting on the waves.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I'd sooner be dead and buried than let my life
be embittered so by my property.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Who takes life lightly does not take death
hard.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> As a child I always had the most horrible fear
of death.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> That is just why I married you.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>With her arms round his neck.</i>) You're in
bad humor. You give yourself too much work. For
weeks and months I've seen nothing of you.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Stroking her hair.</i>) Your light-heartedness
should cheer up my old days.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Indeed, you didn't marry me at all.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Who else did I marry then?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I married you!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> How does that alter anything?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I was always afraid it would alter a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> It has, indeed, crushed a great deal underfoot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> But not one thing, praise God!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Of that I should be covetous.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Your love for me. (<i>Schön's face twitches, he
signs to her to go out in front of him. Both exeunt lower
right. Countess Geschwitz cautiously opens the rear door,
ventures forth, and listens. Hearing voices approaching in
the gallery above her, she starts suddenly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> Oh dear, there's somebody&mdash; (<i>Hides
behind the fire-screen.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Steps out from the curtains onto the
stairs, turns back.</i>) Has the youngster left his heart behind
him in the "Nightlight" café?</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Between the curtains.</i>) He is still too
small for the great world, and can't walk so far on foot
yet. (<i>He disappears.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Coming down the stairs.</i>) God be
thanked we're home again at last! What damned skunk
has waxed the stairs again? If I have to have my joints
set in plaster again before being called home, she can
just present me between the palms here to her relations as
the Venus de' Medici. Nothing but steep rocks and
stumbling blocks!</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Comes down the stairs, carrying Hugenberg
in his arms.</i>) This thing has a royal police-captain for a
father and not as much courage in his body as the raggedest
hobo!</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> If there was nothing more to it than life
and death, then you'd soon learn to know me!</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> Even with his lover's woe, little brother
don't weigh more than sixty kilos. I'll let myself be
hung on that statement any time.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Throw him up to the ceiling and catch
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a>] </span>him by the feet. That'll whip his young blood into the
proper rhythm right from the start.</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> (<i>Kicking his legs.</i>) Hooray, hooray, I
shall be expelled from school!</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Setting him down at the foot of the stairs.</i>)
You've never been to any sensible school at all yet.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Here many a man has already won his
spurs. Only, no timidity! First, I'll set before you a
drop of what can't be had anywhere for money. (<i>Opens
a cupboard under the stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> Now if she doesn't come dancing in on
the instant, I'll wallop you two so you'll still rub your
tails in the hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Seated left of the table.</i>) The strongest
man in the world little brother will wallop! Let mamma
put long trowsers on you first. (<i>Hugenberg sits opposite
him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> I'd rather you lent me your mustache.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> Maybe you want her to throw you out of
the door straight off?</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> If I only knew now what the devil I
was going to say to her!</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> That she knows best herself.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Putting two bottles and three glasses on
the table.</i>) I started in on one of them yesterday. (<i>Fills
the glasses.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Guarding Hugenberg's.</i>) Don't give him
too much, or we'll both have to pay for it.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Supporting himself with both hands on
the table-top.</i>) Will the gentlemen smoke?</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> (<i>Opening his cigarette case.</i>) Havana-imported!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a>] </span><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Helping himself.</i>) From papa police-captain?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Sitting.</i>) Everything in the house is
mine. You only need to ask.</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> I made a poem to her yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> What did you make to her?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> What did he make to her?</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> A poem.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>To Schigolch.</i>) A poem.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> He's promised me a dollar if I can spy out
where he can meet her alone.</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> Just who does live here?</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> Here <em>we</em> live!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Jour fix&mdash;every stock-market day! Our
health. (<i>They clink.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> Should I read it to her first, maybe?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>To Rodrigo.</i>) What's he mean?</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> His poem. He'd like to stretch her out and
torture her a little first.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Staring at Hugenberg.</i>) His eyes! His
eyes!</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> His eyes, yes. They've robbed her of sleep
for a week.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>To Rodrigo.</i>) You can have yourself
pickled.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> We can both have ourselves pickled! Our
health, gossip Death!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Clinking with him.</i>) Health, jack-in-the-box!
If it's still better later on, I'm ready for departure
at any moment; but&mdash;but&mdash; (<i>Lulu enters right,
in an elegant Parisian ball-dress, much décolleté, with
flowers in breast and hair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> But children, children, I expect company!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> But I can tell you what, those things must
cost something over there! (<i>Hugenberg has risen. Lulu
sits on the arm of his chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You've fallen into pretty company! I expect
visitors, children!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> I guess I've got to stick something in
there, too. (<i>He searches among the flowers on the table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Do I look well?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> What are those you've got there?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Orchids. (<i>Bending over Hugenberg.</i>) Smell.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> Do you expect Prince Escerny?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Shaking her head.</i>) God forbid!</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> So somebody else again&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> The prince has gone traveling.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> To put his kingdom up for auction?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He's spying out a fresh tribe in the neighborhood
of Africa. (<i>Rises, hurries up the stairs, and steps
into the gallery.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>To Schigolch.</i>) He wanted to marry her
originally.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> (<i>Sticking a lily in his button-hole.</i>) I,
too, wanted to marry her originally.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> You wanted to marry her originally?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Didn't you, too, want to marry her
originally?</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> You bet I wanted to marry her originally!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Who has not wanted to marry her originally!!</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> I would never have got a better!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> She has let no one regret that he didn't
marry her.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> Then she's not your child?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Never occurs to her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a>] </span><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> What is her father's name then?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> She has boasted of me!</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> What is her father's name then?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> What's he say?</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> What her father's name is.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> She never had one.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Comes down from the gallery and sits again
on Hugenberg's chair-arm.</i>) What have I never had?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALL THREE.</span> A father.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Yes, sure&mdash;I'm a wonder-child. (<i>To Hugenberg.</i>)
How are you getting along with your father?</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> He smokes a respectable cigar, anyway, the
police-captain.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Have you locked up upstairs?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> There is the key.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Better have left it in the lock.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> So no one can unlock it from outside.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> Isn't he at the stock-exchange?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Oh, yes, but he suffers from persecution-mania.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> I take him by the feet, and yup!&mdash;there he
stays sticking to the roof.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He hunts you into a mouse-hole with the corner
of his eye.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> What does he hunt? Who does he hunt?
(<i>Baring his arm.</i>) Just look at this biceps!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Show me. (<i>Goes left.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Hitting himself on the muscle.</i>) Granite.
Wrought-iron!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Feeling by turns Rodrigo's arm and her own.</i>)
If you only didn't have such long ears&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">FERDINAND.</span> (<i>Entering, rear-centre.</i>) Doctor Schön!</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> The rogue! (<i>Jumps up, starts behind the
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a>] </span>fire-screen, recoils.</i>) God preserve me! (<i>Hides, lower
left, behind the curtains.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHIGOLCH.</span> Give me the key! (<i>Takes it and drags
himself up the stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Hugenberg having slid under the table.</i>)
Show him in!</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> (<i>Under the front edge of the table-cloth,
listening; to himself.</i>) If he doesn't stay&mdash;we'll be alone.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Poking him with her toe.</i>) Sh! (<i>Hugenberg
disappears. Alva is shown in by Ferdinand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>In evening dress.</i>) Methinks the matinee will
take place with burning lamps. I've&mdash; (<i>Notices Schigolch
painfully climbing the stairs.</i>) What the &mdash;&mdash; is
that?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> An old friend of your father's.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Wholly unknown to me.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> They were in the campaign together. He's awfully
badly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Is my father here then?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He drank a glass with him. He had to go to
the stock market. We'll have lunch before we go, won't
we?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> When does it begin?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> After two. (<i>Alva still follows Schigolch with
his eyes.</i>) How do you like me? (<i>Schigolch disappears
thru the gallery.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Had I not better be silent to you on that point?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I only mean my appearance.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Your dressmaker manifestly knows you better
than I may permit myself to know you.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> When I saw myself in the glass I could have
wished to be a man&mdash;my man!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You seem to envy your man the joy you offer
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a>] </span>to him. (<i>Lulu is at the right, Alva at the left, of the
centre table. He regards her with shy satisfaction. Ferdinand
enters, rear, covers the table and lays two plates, etc.,
a bottle of Pommery, and hors d'&nbsp;oeuvres.</i>) Have you a
toothache?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Across to Alva.</i>) Don't.</p>

<p><span class="small">FERDINAND.</span> Doctor Schön&nbsp;...?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> He seems so puckered-up and tearful to-day.</p>

<p><span class="small">FERDINAND.</span> (<i>Thru his teeth.</i>) One is only a man
after all. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>When both are seated.</i>) What I always
think most highly of in you is your firmness of character.
You're so perfectly sure of yourself. Even when you must
have been afraid of quarreling with your father about it,
you always stood up for me like a brother just the same.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Let's drop that. It's just my fate&mdash; (<i>Moves
to lift up the table-cloth in front.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Quickly.</i>) That was me.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Impossible! It's just my fate, with the most
frivolous ideas always to seize on the best.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You deceive yourself if you make yourself out
worse than you are.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Why do you flatter me so? It is true that
perhaps there is no man living, so bad as I&mdash;who has
brought about so much good.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> In any case you're the only man in the world
who's protected me without lowering me in my own eyes!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Do you think that so easy? (<i>Schön appears in
the gallery cautiously parting the hangings between the
middle pillars. He starts, and whispers, "My own son!"</i>)
With gifts from God like yours, one turns those around
one to criminals without ever dreaming of it. I, too, am
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a>] </span>only flesh and blood, and if we hadn't grown up with each
other like brother and sister&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> That's why, too, I give myself to you alone
quite without reserve. From you I have nothing to fear.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I assure you there are moments when one
expects to see one's whole inner self cave in. The more self-restraint
a man loads onto himself, the easier he breaks
down. Nothing will save him from that except&mdash; (<i>Stops
to look under the table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Quickly.</i>) What are you looking for?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I conjure you, let me keep my confession of
faith to myself! As an inviolable sanctity you were more
to me than with all your gifts you could be to anyone else
in your life!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> How do you come to think on that so entirely
differently from your father? (<i>Ferdinand enters, rear,
changes the plates and serves broiled chicken with salad.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>To him.</i>) Are you sick?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>To Alva.</i>) Let him be!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> He's trembling as if he had fever.</p>

<p><span class="small">FERDINAND.</span> I am not yet so used to waiting&nbsp;...</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You must have something prescribed for you.</p>

<p><span class="small">FERDINAND.</span> (<i>Thru his teeth.</i>) I'm a coachman
usually&mdash; (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Whispering from the gallery.</i>) So, he too.
(<i>Seats himself behind the rail, able to cover himself with
the hangings.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> What sort of moments are those of which you
spoke, where one expects to see his whole inner self
tumble in?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I <em>didn't want</em> to speak of them. I should
not like to lose, in joking over a glass of champagne,
what has been my highest happiness for ten years.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> I have hurt you. I won't begin on that again.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Do you promise me that for always?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> My hand on it. (<i>Gives him her hand across
the table. Alva takes it hesitatingly, grips it in his, and
presses it long and ardently to his lips.</i>) What are you
doing. (<i>Rodrigo sticks his head out from the curtains,
left. Lulu darts an angry look at him across Alva, and
he draws back.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Whispering from the gallery.</i>) And there
is still another!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Holding the hand.</i>) A soul&mdash;that in the
hereafter rubs the sleep out of its eyes.... Oh, this
hand....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Innocently.</i>) What do you find in it?...</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> An arm....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> What do you find in it?...</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> A body.....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Guilelessly.</i>) What do you find in it?...</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Stirred up.</i>) Mignon!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Wholly ingenuously.</i>) What do you find in
it?...</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Passionately.</i>) Mignon! Mignon!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Throws herself on the ottoman.</i>) Don't look
at me so&mdash;for God's sake! Let us go before it is too
late. You're an infamous wretch!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I told you, didn't I, I was the basest villain.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I see that!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I have no sense of honor, no pride....</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You think I am your equal!</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> You?&mdash;you are as heavenly high above me as&mdash;as
the sun is over the abyss! (<i>Kneeling.</i>) Destroy me!
I beg you, put an end to me! Put an end to me!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Do you <em>love</em> me then?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a>] </span><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I will pay you with everything that was mine!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Do you love me?</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Do you love me&mdash;Mignon?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I? Not a soul.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> I love you. (<i>Hides his face in her lap.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Both hands in his hair.</i>) I poisoned your
mother&mdash; (<i>Rodrigo sticks his head out from the curtains,
left, sees Schön sitting in the gallery and signs to
him to watch Lulu and Alva. Schön points his revolver
at Rodrigo; Rodrigo signs to him to point it at Alva.
Schön cocks the revolver and takes aim. Rodrigo draws
back behind the curtains. Lulu sees him draw back, sees
Schön sitting in the gallery, and gets up.</i>) His father!
(<i>Schön rises, lets the hangings fall before him. Alva remains
motionless on his knees. Pause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Holding a paper in his hand, takes Alva by
the shoulder.</i>) Alva! (<i>Alva gets up as though drunk
with sleep.</i>) A revolution has broken out in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> To Paris ... let me go to Paris&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> In the editors' room they're beating their heads
against the wall. No one knows what he ought to write.
(<i>He unfolds the paper and accompanies Alva out, rear.
Rodrigo rushes out from the curtains toward the stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Barring his way.</i>) You can't get out here.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> Let me through!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You'll run into his arms.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> He'll shoot me thru the head!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He's coming.</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> (<i>Stumbling back.</i>) Devil, death and demons!
(<i>Lifts the table-cloth.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> No room!</p>

<p><span class="small">RODRIGO.</span> Damned and done for! (<i>Looks around and
hides in the door-way, right.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Comes in, centre; locks the door; and goes,
revolver in hand, to the window down left, of which he
throws up the curtains.</i>) Where is <em>he</em> gone?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>On the lowest step.</i>) Out.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Down over the balcony?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He's an acrobat.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> That could not be foreseen. (<i>Turning
against Lulu.</i>) You who drag me thru the muck of the
streets to a tortured death!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Why did you not bring me up better?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> You destroying angel! You inexorable fate!
To be a murderer without drowning in filth; to take me
on board like a released convict, or hang me up over the
morass! You joy of my old age! You hangman's noose!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>In cold blood.</i>) Oh, shut up, and kill me!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Everything I possess I have made over to you,
and asked nothing but the respect that every servant pays
to my house. Your credit is exhausted!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I can answer for my reckoning still for years.
(<i>Coming forward from the stairs.</i>) How do you like my
new gown?</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Away with you, or my brains will give way
to-morrow and my son swim in his own blood! You
infect me like an incurable pest in which I shall groan away
the rest of my life. I <em>will</em> cure myself! Do you
understand? (<i>Pressing the revolver on her.</i>) This is
your physic. Don't break down; don't kneel! You yourself
shall apply it. You or I&mdash;which is the weaker?
(<i>Lulu, her strength threatening to desert her, has sunk
down on the couch. Turning the revolver this way and
that.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> It doesn't go off.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a>] </span><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Do you still remember how I tore you out of
the clutches of the police?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You have much confidence&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Because I'm not afraid of a street-girl? Shall
I guide your hand for you? Have you no mercy towards
yourself? (<i>Lulu points the revolver at him.</i>) No false
alarms! (<i>Lulu fires a shot into the ceiling. Rodrigo
springs out of the portières, up the stairs and away thru
the gallery.</i>) What was that?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Innocently.</i>) Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Lifting the portières.</i>) What flew out of
here?</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You're suffering from persecution-mania.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Have you got still more men hidden here?
(<i>Tearing the revolver from her.</i>) Is yet another man
calling on you? (<i>Going left.</i>) I'll regale your men!
(<i>Throws up the window curtains, flings the fire-screen
back, grabs Countess Geschwitz by the collar and drags
her forward.</i>) Did you come down the chimney?</p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>In deadly terror, to Lulu.</i>) Save me
from him!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Shaking her.</i>) Or are you, too, an acrobat?</p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> (<i>Whimpering.</i>) You hurt me.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Shaking her.</i>) Now you will <em>have</em> to
stay to dinner. (<i>Drags her right, shoves her into the next
room and locks the door after her.</i>) We want no town-criers.
(<i>Sits next Lulu and makes her take the revolver
again.</i>) There's still enough for you in it. Look at me!
I cannot assist the coachman in my house to decorate
my forehead for me. Look at me! I pay my coachman.
Look at me! Am I doing the coachman a favor when
I can't stand the stable-stench?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a>] </span><span class="small">LULU.</span> Have the carriage got ready! Please! We're
going to the opera.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> We're going to the devil! Now I am coachman.
(<i>Turning the revolver in her hand from himself
to Lulu's breast.</i>) Think you we let ourselves be mistreated
as you mistreat me, and hesitate between a galley-slave's
shame at the end of life and the merit of freeing
the world of <em>you</em>? (<i>Holds her down by the arm.</i>)
Come, get through. It will be the gladdest remembrance
of my life. Pull the trigger!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> You can get a divorce.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Only that was left! In order that to-morrow
the next man may find his pastime where I have shuddered
from cleft to chasm, suicide upon me and <em>thou</em>
before me! You dare suggest that? That part of my
life I have poured into you I am to see thrown before
wild beasts? Do you see your bed with the sacrifice&mdash;the
victim&mdash;on it? The boy is homesick for you. Did you
let yourself be divorced? You trod him under your feet,
knocked out his brains, caught up his blood in gold-pieces.
I let myself be divorced? <em>Can</em> one be divorced when two
people have grown into each other and half the man must
go, too? (<i>Reaching for the revolver.</i>) Give it here!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Don't!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> I'll spare you the trouble.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Tears herself loose, holding the revolver
down; in a determined, self-possessed tone.</i>) If men have
killed themselves for my sake, that doesn't lower my value.
You know as well why you made me your wife as I knew
why I took you for husband. You had deceived your best
friends with me; you could not well go on deceiving yourself
with me. If you bring me the close of your life as a
sacrifice, still you have had my whole youth for it. You
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a>] </span>understand ten times better than I do which is the more
valuable. I have never in the world wished to seem to be
anything different from what I am taken for, and I have
never in the world been taken for anything different from
what I am. You want to force me to fire a bullet into
my heart. I'm not sixteen any more, but to fire a bullet
in my heart I am still much too young!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Pursuing her.</i>) Down, murderess! Down
with you! To your knees, murderess! (<i>Crowding her
to the foot of the stairs.</i>) Down, and never dare to stand
again! (<i>Raising his hand. Lulu has sunk to her knees.</i>)
Pray to God, murderess, that he give you strength. Sue
to heaven that strength for it may be lent you! (<i>Hugenberg
jumps up from under the table, knocking a chair
aside, and screams "Help!" Schön whirls toward him,
turning his back to Lulu who instantly fires five shots into
him and continues to pull the trigger. Schön, tottering
over, is caught by Hugenberg and let down in the chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> And&mdash;there&mdash;is&mdash;one&mdash;more&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Rushing to Schön.</i>) All merciful&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Out of my sight! Alva!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Kneeling.</i>) The one man I loved!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Harlot! Murderess! Alva! Alva! Water!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> Water; he's thirsty. (<i>Fills a glass with champagne
and sets it to Schön's lips. Alva comes thru the
gallery, down the stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Father! O God, my father!</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> I shot him.</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> She is innocent!</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>To Alva.</i>) You! It miscarried.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>Tries to lift him.</i>) You must go to bed;
come.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> Don't take me so! I'm drying up. (<i>Lulu
<span class='pagenum'>[Page <a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a>] </span>comes with the champagne-cup; to her.</i>) You are still like
yourself. (<i>After drinking.</i>) Don't let her escape. (<i>To
Alva.</i>) You are the next.</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>To Hugenberg.</i>) Help me carry him to bed.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> No, no, please, no. Wine, murderess&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> (<i>To Hugenberg.</i>) Take him up that side.
(<i>Pointing right.</i>) Into the bed-room. (<i>They lift Schön
upright and lead him right. Lulu stays near the table,
the glass in her hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">SCHÖN.</span> (<i>Groaning.</i>) O God! O God! O God!
(<i>Alva finds the door locked, turns the key and opens it.
Countess Geschwitz steps out. Schön at the sight of her
straighten up, stiffly.</i>) The Devil. (<i>He falls backward
onto the carpet. Lulu throws herself down, takes his head
in her lap, and kisses him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> He has got over it. (<i>Gets up and starts toward
the stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> Don't stir!</p>

<p><span class="small">GESCHWITZ.</span> I thought it was you.</p>

<p><span class="small">LULU.</span> (<i>Throwing herself before Alva.</i>) You can't
give me up to the law! It is <em>my</em> head that is struck off.
I shot him because he was about to shoot me. I have
loved nobody in the world but him! Alva, demand what
you will, only don't let me fall into the hands of justice.
Take pity on me. I am still young. I will be true to you
as long as I live. I will belong only to you. Look at me,
Alva. Man, look at me! Look at me!! (<i>Knocking on
the door outside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">ALVA.</span> The police. (<i>Goes to open it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="small">HUGENBERG.</span> I shall be expelled from school.</p>
